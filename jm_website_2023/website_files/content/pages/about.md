### About Jonathan Mair

I am a social scientist, consultant and entrepreneur, enjoying life in the sun in Andaluc√≠a since 2020. Together with my wife, [Baozhen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baozhen-shi-a8327420/), I provide support for businesses working on intercultural projects, especially projects with a China connection. You can read more about our services and work at [The China Mix](https://chinamix.co.uk) and [Sensible Martian](https://sensiblemartian.com).

I am a trained social anthropologist, reading for undergraduate and graduate degrees at [Cambridge University](https://www.cam.ac.uk). I spent a decade and a half working as a teacher and researcher in UK universities. I have held research fellowships at [St John's College, Cambridge](https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk) and the [Cambridge Centre for Research on Social Sciences and Humanities](https://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk). 

I have taught and supervised research projects at the universities of Cambridge and [Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk), and by 2019 I was responsible for running undergraduate degrees in social anthropology at the [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk). I have served as external examiner/assesor for PhDs at the [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk) and for research grant applications to the Research Council for Culture and Society of the [Academy of Finland](http://www.aka.fi). Between 2018 and 2020, I was Honorary Secretary of the Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK (the [ASA](https://www.theasa.org)).

As a researcher, I have carried out my own long-term ethnographic projects in Inner Mongolia (northern China), and in Taiwan, as well a shorter studies in Singapore, London, Manchester and Paris. I have published on a range of issues, including the revival of religion in contemporary China, the meaning of belief, the cultural complexities of ignorance, post-truth and metacognition. 

Alongside my academic work, I always had an interest in technology and business. In 2012, together with Baozhen, I founded The Chinese Language Consultancy Limited, which we would later rename The China Mix Ltd. In the early 2000s, I spent two years working as a developer (Java, Perl, PHP) and these days I enjoy working with Python.
