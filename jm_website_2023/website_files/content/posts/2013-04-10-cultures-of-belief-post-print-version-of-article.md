As promised, here’s a post-print version of my Cultures of Belief article, which was published in Anthropological Theory.

The text is identical to the journal version, but the formatting is different — this is the version I’m allowed to distribute according to the publishing agreement. If you have access to the journal, for example through a library, you can see a prettier version [here](http://ant.sagepub.com/content/12/4/448).
