[The China History Podcast](http://chinahistorypodcast.com/) comes all the way from sunny Claremont, California, courtesy of [Laszlo Montgomery](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2011-06/17/content_12720818.htm "Laszlo Montgomery"), and is highly recommended. I’ve been listening to it on and off since last summer and have learnt a lot from it.

It’s a great introduction to some key episodes and themes in Chinese history, and the host has a nice, calm, leisurely style of delivery that makes a good contrast for turbulent history he is usually recounting. And at 3-4 episodes a month, of 30+ minutes each, this guy is amazingly productive.
