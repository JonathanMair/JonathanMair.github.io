I’ve launched a new website as part of my current project at CRASSH. It’s called [ethics.CRASSH](http://ethics.crassh.cam.ac.uk) and at the moment it’s covering the Speaking Ethically Across Borders Project, which has been running as a reading group this year. Several of the participants have already posted commentaries on the texts we’ve been reading. If things go well, I hope this will develop as a more general resource for interdisciplinary studies of ethics in Cambridge and beyond.

If you are interested in writing something for the blog, please let me know.
