For my students in the Key Debates in Anthropology course – this week’s episode of [BBC Radio 4’s Great Lives](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01gvn2k) may be of interest. It’s on Edward Said, whose *Orientalism* we debated earlier in the year. The host is the excellent Matthew Parris, in discussion with ‘expert witnesses’ and the comedian [Alexei Sayle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6w4YvKy8kY), who nominated Said for this programme. It should be available to listen to on the BBC iPlayer for the next couple of weeks, though I’m not sure it will be available from outside the UK.
