Here’a another exercise in the anthropology of ignorance, this time focused on ignorance in education — a special issue of *Critical Studies in Education* from 2009.

The introduction, by Neriko Musha Doerr explains:

> While resonating with Bourdieu’s theoretical formulation that it is relations of dominance that create the legitimacy of knowledge, this project pushes a step further and argues that the relations of dominance can create legitimacy even in ignorance.
