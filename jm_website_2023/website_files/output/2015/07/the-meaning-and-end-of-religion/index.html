                <p>Over the weekend I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_Cantwell_Smith">Wilfred
Cantwell Smith</a>‘s <em>The Meaning and End of Religion</em>
(1962)<em>.</em> I knew a little about this book from Talal Asad’s 2001
<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3176697?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">article</a>
(jStor paywall), which I suppose is the main way most anthropologists of
religion have come to know its content too. Asad lavishes praise on
Smith at the beginning of the article—the book is a ‘modern classic’,
and so on—but most of his article is a pretty unrelenting takedown. I
have always taken it for granted that Asad’s precis is a reliable
description of Smith’s position, but now I’ve actually read the book,
I’ve found that the argument is much more subtle, and that many (but not
all) of Asad’s criticisms are&nbsp;unfair.</p>
<p>Smith begins his book by asking a question that had exercised many
other scholars before him: ‘What is religion?’. However, his answer is
quite original. Religion, he argues, is not a constant feature of human
experience, but a historical phenomenon which, being historical, had a
beginning and has continued to change. As it is changing and
heterogeneous, it sometimes has included things that at other times were
excluded. Therefore attempting to understand ‘religion’ as if it was a
stable thing is bound to be misleading. There is little we can say about
it as a category, except to trace its history, and he therefore calls
for the term to be dropped as an analytical tool&nbsp;altogether.</p>
<p>Asad writes that Smith is the first anti-essentialist theorist of
religion, but that’s not all he is, and for me he stands awkwardly
between the essentialists and the anti-essentialists. His account of the
history of the religion concept is in some ways much more wide-ranging
and complex than more recent accounts with which I’m more&nbsp;familiar.</p>
<p>Yet in his claim that the experience of the transcendent is universal
and in some sense ahistorical, he looks like earlier generations of
anthropologists/sociologists/historians of religion, such as Durkheim
and Frazer, who sought to define religion as a trans-historical
category. And there are precedents, too, for the confessional position
that the true purpose of religious practice is a personal relationship
or encounter with the transcendent, for example, in the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Underhill">Evelyn
Underhill</a>.*</p>
<p>Smith predicted that sociologists would be uncomfortable with the
idea of building the category of the transcendent into their studies. It
does make me uncomfortable, and my instinct is to seek to historicize
the transcendent—is the transcendent/immanent opposition really
universal, as he assumes? can’t its development be traced? isn’t it
dependent on a certain kind of cosmology?—but the sophistication of
Smith’s writing has certainly made me a bit more open to the
idea….still, if you’ll permit me to mangle a metaphor, I can’t help
feeling that in throwing the bathwater out of the analytical bath, he’s
kept back a bit, mistaking it for a baby. If you see what I&nbsp;mean.</p>
<p>Smith argues that religion is a confusing term that is used to refer
to a number of different things. These things are, he says, quite
distinct, but they are conflated as a result of the contemporary
application of the term ‘religion’ to all of them. They are&nbsp;(48f):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1) A personal relationship to transcendence, piety</strong>
(in this sense we say someone is more or less religious than ten years&nbsp;ago)</li>
<li><strong>A system of beliefs, practices, values, or whatever,
extending over time and space</strong> (in this sense we distinguish one
religion from another)—this can be further analysed into two separate
phenomena: <strong>(2)</strong> the <strong>ideal religion</strong> of
theologians, seldom if ever realised in life, and <strong>(3)</strong>
the <strong>messy, human reality</strong> of&nbsp;sociologists</li>
<li><strong>(4) Religion in general</strong>, as opposed to other realms
of&nbsp;life</li>
</ul>
<p>For Smith, the most important of all of these is the first, which he
proposes to call ‘faith’. He says that faith—a relationship of
obedience, submission or recognition of the transcendent, is a human
universal. This faith finds expression in practices, art, music,
theology and so on, but they are not it. The phenomena described by (2),
(3), and (4) are, unlike personal faith or piety, historical
developments and are therefore messy, heterogeneous, and without a
stable&nbsp;essence.</p>
<p>The conflation of these four aspects under the rubric of ‘religion’
leads to a number of problems. These problems are not consistently
distinguished by Smith, and the following enumeration may just be my
reading, but I think a passage near the very end of the book, where he
explains that his argument has relevance to religious people, to
students of religion, and for humanity at large, does indicate that he
thinks of them as separate&nbsp;problems.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> the religious problem. As a religious
person, Smith thinks that faith, piety, the personal encounter of an
individual with the transcendent, is undermined when people conflate it
with its expression. The result is a focus on contingent externals,
rather than the relationship itself. He doesn’t argue, I think, that the
external expressions of faith is unimportant (this is key to my
disagreement with Asad) but rather that treating them as
<em>religion</em> may lead people to neglect faith and to become too
attached to specifics that should be seen as accidents of&nbsp;history.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem 2:</strong> the sociological problem. As the
meaning of the term ‘religion’ has a history, it is confusing when
applied anachronistically across periods in history, or ethnocentrically
to other cultures, and it should be dropped. For instance, the idea that
religion is distinguished from the secular is distinctively a
characteristic of European religion, because there Christianity came to
dominate, but existed alongside political traditions with classical
roots, which only then were understood as secular. When looking at
specific traditions, such as Buddhism or Islam, we should not look for a
defining essence or genius, but accept that they are ever branching,
heterogeneous, contingent accumulations. When trying to understand the
influence of a religious tradition on an individual follower of that
tradition, we can take into account only those aspects of the tradition
of which the follower is aware, rather than trying to define the essence
of the religion explaining his or her actions in the light of that&nbsp;essence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem 3:</strong> the human problem. Smith suggests
that the reification of religion is the cause of conflict. If we
recognised the universality of the human relationship with
transcendence—that is, of faith—we’d learn to tolerate and appreciate
each other’s concrete expressions of that&nbsp;relationship.</p></li>
