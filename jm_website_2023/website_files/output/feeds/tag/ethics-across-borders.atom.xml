&lt;p&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen a dramatic growth in the study of ethics among
social anthropologists. Much of this growth has been due to the
assimilation into anthropological thinking of virtue ethics building on
two streams of theoretical work: that of Foucault, and that of virtue
ethicists working in the Anglo-Saxon philosophical tradition. Proponents
of the virtue-ethics approach in anthropology argue that a focus on
self-cultivation as a process allows for sufficient attention to be paid
to self-conscious reflection. Reflection and the freedom it entails,
they argue, are essential aspects of ethical life that traditional
social scientific approaches to ethics – Durkheimian approaches – simply&amp;nbsp;ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There appears to remain an area of ethical experience, however, that
neither approach can easily accommodate. Since virtue ethics sees
ethical judgment as the result of cultivation within a self-conscious
ethical tradition, it can no more account for ethical judgment outside
of or between traditions than the Durkheimian approach can. Yet history
is full of situations in which multiple, self-conscious ethical
traditions meet, and in which people try to judge each other, persuade
each other, or draw lessons from each other across the borders that
separate those traditions. These situations are what we call ‘speaking
ethically across borders’, and this is the phenomenon that the
conference will aim to&amp;nbsp;explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these situations, are people limited to using values with which
they are already familiar to interpret and judge other values? Or can
they genuinely learn from alternative ethical systems? If so, on what
conditions does this process depend? Is the capacity for or disposition
towards a cosmopolitan attitude to ethics itself a culturally specific
norm or a virtue to be perfected, or is it a necessary aspect of ethical
thought? Ethnographically speaking, how have people in fact used the
intellectual resources provided by one ethical tradition to judge
others? How have they sought to borrow from other traditions, or to
persuade followers of other traditions to adopt novel values and
practices? What meta-ethics have specific traditions proposed to govern
the relationship of members of the tradition to the mores of other&amp;nbsp;traditions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PW&lt;/span&gt;: Can you be a cosmopolitan if you don’t have to commitments to a
place or people or maybe even culture? Is it possible to be a
cosmopolitan without this rootedness&amp;nbsp;somewhere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SH&lt;/span&gt;: Well I would have said not, and I think I’m afraid of the word
because it sort of suggests that. It sort of invokes a kind of
cultureless, rootedless image of a person who’s free-floating sampling
all the cultures, like my global entrepreneur in the first-class waiting
room of some airport is a good idea – they love a bit of Japanese
cooking, Indian cooking here, French cuisine there. They sample all of
them but none comes from a attachment to a particular way of handling
food et cetera. That doesn’t mean you need to eat that way all the time
but you sort of know what it is like to be attached. I think that
without that the old Marxist jibe ‘rootless cosmopolitanism’ has some
substance to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in many ways, this is where we encounter an interesting
interface with one aspect of liberalism which exactly thinks we can only
really calculate what individuals are like when we free them from all
their attachments: no religion, no culture nothing, free floating atoms
contracting with other free floating atoms, and I think this is exactly
one of the limitations of liberalism. It has never understood culture,
not [that] it has never sunk itself into culture, it has never
*understood* culture. This idea of the atomised individual has of course
played it’s role. The notion of the rule of law depends on a certain
abstraction from cultures and particularities, so it does have it’s
value, but it’s never understood that it’s always underpinned by its own
culture. There’s no liberal democracy that doesn’t have roots in a
particular&amp;nbsp;community….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I believe in that locatedness, in position, attachment, but I
believe that those are rarely singular. I don’t think they overlap, that
the attachment to community is the same as the attachment to culture,
and I think that all of that has to be aware of its&amp;nbsp;limits.&lt;/p&gt;
