&lt;p&gt;the fundamental questions remains: Why are only “religious”
communities able to augment this in-group cooperation not, say,
political parties or sport&amp;nbsp;clubs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly an interesting question, and one that is not
affected by the objections in my previous post, but I do have some
reservations on this count&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="comparing-like-with-like"&gt;1. Comparing like with&amp;nbsp;like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can address the question, we need to make sure we’re
comparing like with like. From your &lt;a href="http://www.scilogs.com/nature-of-faith/its-about-fertility-stupid-the-evolutionary-adaptivity-of-religion/"&gt;original
post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found many religious traditions that were able to attain high
levels of fertility throughout the generations. But in sharp empirical
contrast, we didn’t find a single non-religious community, movement or
population that was able to retain at least replacement level (two
births per woman) for a&amp;nbsp;century!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way you put this explicitly rules out any kind of organization
that is not involved in baby making (“two births per woman”). That’s
fair enough, as you’re interested in evolution, which ultimately depends
on differential reproductive advantage. But doing this also means that
you cannot legitimately take such organizations as sports clubs as
secular equivalents of religious groups in your comparisons. Of course
tennis clubs can’t achieve two births per woman — they don’t (as far as
I know) admit members by birth! This has no necessary or causal relation
to&amp;nbsp;religiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;
Mongolian Medal: ‘Aldart Ekh’ — Renowned Mother, First Class
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a comparison in terms of replacement by birth — the
comparison that would allow us to reach the conclusion that religious
communities have an advantage over non-religious ones in terms of
reproduction — &lt;strong&gt;we’d have to find non-religious organizations
that *did* base membership at least in part on reproduction and&amp;nbsp;birth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to non-reproduction related groups such as sports clubs
and political parties, it is hard to think of many examples. Why that
should be the case is an interesting question in itself — I’ll consider
that&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some modernist nationalisms (especially those allied to
eugenic policies?), or ethnic groups without strong religious
affiliation (some national minorities in China?) would fit the&amp;nbsp;bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are good examples of the former — I’m thinking especially of
the Hero Mother campaigns in the Soviet Union and other Communist
countries, and these did achieve very high birth rates. Some people have
argued that Stalinism had religious characteristics — maybe so, but it
was certainly not interested in non-empirical agents
(i.e. ‘religiosity’, in your terms). When I first went to Ulanbaatar in
2002, many people still proudly declared themselves ‘materialist’ when I
asked them about religion! These national movements really did achieve
huge population growth. Admittedly, it was not sustained over much more
than two&amp;nbsp;generations….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-historical-question"&gt;2. The historical&amp;nbsp;question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…Which brings us to my second reservation: the historical depth, or
lack of it, of non-religious&amp;nbsp;organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were going to make a generalization about the relative
reproductive success of religious and non-religious communities, one
that is to hold good across evolutionary time, we would need to have a
decent number of examples of both kinds of&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are good reasons to think it is impossible to find a sufficient
sample of non-religious, membership-by-reproduction&amp;nbsp;communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason is the historical novelty of secularism. The idea of
having communities or institutions that exclude religiosity (on your
definition) simply does not have a long history. It is an idea that had
its origins in the Enlightenment or the development of the nation state
(see Talal Asad, Charles Taylor — refs&amp;nbsp;below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more general account might give a role to the modern phenomenon of
‘purification’. Early anthropologists were fascinated by the fact that
the institutions they studied among ‘natives’ in colonial contexts
around the world could not be pigeonholed into one of the major
categories that we use to understand modern society, such as politics,
economics, kinship, religion and so on. For example, an annual meeting
between villages might involve arrangements for marriages (kinship),
exchanges of goods (economics), offerings to ancestors (religion), and
alliances (politics). Marcel Mauss called this a total&amp;nbsp;institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, modern societies are characterized by an attempt to
purify institutions so that they only perform one kind of role…if your
economic institution also performs kinship functions, that’s called
nepotism! If your political institution performs commercial functions,
corruption! Bruno Latour has argued that this work of purification is
more rhetorical than&amp;nbsp;actual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the evidence seems to suggest that secular communities in
general were either very rare or non-existent (on a broad or narrow
definition of secularism, respectively) until the modern
period.&lt;/strong&gt; This explanation accounts parsimoniously for your being
unable to find any long-lived communities defined by their exclusion of
religion throughout history — there simply weren’t any such communities
until relatively&amp;nbsp;recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the lack of longstanding communities of this kind were instead
down to relative reproductive disadvantage, am I wrong in thinking that
we should see a long history of ephemeral secular birth-related
communities that die out quickly? Can you name any one such community
dating to before 1600? The examples you give of communities that did not
prosper are defined by their &lt;em&gt;religious&lt;/em&gt; characteristics — they
don’t appear to be secular in any sense (Shakers, ancient&amp;nbsp;Pagans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it may be too soon to say whether secular birth-related
communities will prove to be successful. It may continue to be difficult
to say: the reason such communities are &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; likely to be rare
may be that the modern practice of purification that I outlined above
tends to militate against birth/kinship functions being mixed up with
other functions. Such a mixture would be a necessary condition of
recognizing a community as anything other than a kinship&amp;nbsp;group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my reservations about comparisons before the modern period and
comparisons are justified, then what remains to be explained is the
apparent reproductive advantage of religiously defined groups over other
groups &lt;em&gt;in the modern period&lt;/em&gt; — accepting your example of
Switzerland as representative and unproblematic. The relation of this
phenomenon to religiosity, on your definition, was the subject of my
previous two&amp;nbsp;posts.&lt;/p&gt;
