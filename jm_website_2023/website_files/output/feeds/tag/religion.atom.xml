post&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to Needham’s review of Veyne’s book. The review is short, and
much is taken up with flattering comments on Veyne’s style, but overall
the conclusion is negative—he characterises the argument as ‘erratic and
inconsistent’. On my reading, Needham makes three substantive points,
which I shall deal with one by one here in order of&amp;nbsp;importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only criticism that really has bite is that Veyne is vague about
what the key terms in his analysis—belief and truth—mean to him. Partly
on the basis of Veyne’s previous work, Needham reads &lt;em&gt;Did the
Greeks…?&lt;/em&gt; as an exercise in epistemological relativism, and makes a
version of the usual objection to the paradoxes of relativism: if truth
is always to be defined in local terms, in relation to historically
specific programmes of truth, as Veyne would have it, then what exactly
does Veyne mean when he says, absolutely, and not qualified by any
context, that truth is&amp;nbsp;plural?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needham&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, Veyne actually concentrates not on belief but on
truth, but only to place himself in a further difficulty. He concedes
that ‘truth’ too means so many things, yet he passes over the variety of
theories of truth and, in the end, commits himself consistently to none.
The nearest he gets to a steady acceptance is to say that truths and
interests, which are both limited and arbitrary, are ‘two different
terms for the same&amp;nbsp;thing’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needham is right to call Veyne out for not clarifying his terms, and
attributing this weakness to strong epistemological relativism is not an
unreasonable interpretation. However, I believe another reading is&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veyne details the variety of ‘regimes of belief’ in terms of
different truth conditions and specific practices, such as the use of
footnotes in academic writing, with which they are associated. These
things are the specific form that believing has, historically taken. But
it is still possible to speak of believing in the abstract, as the
category to which all these concrete modes of belief belong. What is it
that makes the ordinary ancient Greek’s vague and lethargic belief in
gods and heroes an instance of the same class of phenomenon as the
mediaeval lawyer’s insistence on footnotes, and the modern newspaper
reader’s suspicion of bias? They are all specifications of the practical
and social relationship between thinker and what the thinker accepts as
truth. To put it more pithily, belief is about a relationship to a body
of&amp;nbsp;truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit, it’s not clear from Veyne’s text that this is what
&lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; means by belief and truth, but it’s a reading that makes
sense of his concrete claims, and saves his general conclusions from
Needham’s anti-relativist criticism. Needham is right that Veyne is
unclear on this score, and clarifying the meaning of the general
category of belief, and of the general category of truth on which it
depends will be an important task for any ethnographic approach to&amp;nbsp;belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="2" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He complains that Veyne, in seeking to understand belief, did not
take into account the attempts of philosophers such as Wittgenstein,
Hume, Kant, and so on to do the same&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These writers were engaged in what Veyne describes as an exercise of
‘the constitutive imagination’. Like the ancient and modern historians
whom Veyne describes, they were engaged in shaping programmes of truth,
legitimising some ‘regimes of belief’ and delegitimising others. They
were not in the business of describing the plural programmes of truth of
others, and they would only have had a place in the book alongside the
mediaeval jurists and modern journalists that Veyne—as case studies of
the kind of second-order belief theory and practice that Veyne is
interested in&amp;nbsp;describing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Veyne is writing at a higher level of generalisation
or abstraction than Kant et al., and for a different purpose. The
philosophers’ question would not have been ‘Did the Greeks believe in
their myths’, but the logically posterior question, ‘Were the Greeks
right to (dis)believe in their myths?’, which is only meaningful once it
is established whether or not (or to what extent, in what senses) they
did, in fact,&amp;nbsp;believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="3" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, Needham chides Veyne for not taking account of ‘sceptical
anthropology’. He argues that ethnographers have succeeded in explaining
the kinds god-language that Veyne’s question raises, but without
resorting to the notion of belief. He concludes that these&amp;nbsp;writers,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;confirm that it is not ‘pointless’, as Veyne proposes, to try to
determine the true thought of other peoples, but that we shall not do so
if we attribute our thoughts to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No page references are given in the review, but thanks to Google, it
is possible to trace the passage in Veyne’s book to which Needham
refers. Needham suggests that Veyne says it’s pointless ‘…to determine
the true thought of other peoples thought’. The ‘pointless’ here is
taken out of context and is quite misleading. In fact, Veyne was not
saying it was hopeless to try to understand ‘other people’s’ thought,
but that when faced with contradictory forms of thought, one must
recognise the plurality rather than trying to explain it away. The full
passage reads as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struggling to determine ‘the’ true thought of these people is
pointless, and it is equally unproductive to attempt to resolve these
contradictory thoughts by attributing one to popular religion and the
other to the beliefs of the privileged social classes. (Veyne&amp;nbsp;1988:89)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sceptical approach that Needham recommends begins by setting
aside the question of belief. It may have found other explanations for
religious language, and they may be illuminating, but this approach
cannot even recognise the plurality of modes of belief that Veyne draws
our attention to and makes it his business to describe and&amp;nbsp;understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, then, Needham’s critical review does not persuade me that
Veyne’s way of understanding belief is not a really critical piece in
understanding human thought, though Needham is right to say that Veyne
is vague about his key terms. They’re still arguing in my head and Veyne
is still&amp;nbsp;winning.&lt;/p&gt;

of Paul Veyne’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EpbZLRPGgBsC"&gt;Did the Greeks
believe in their myths?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I was quite intrigued by this as these
two authors are representatives of two approaches to the study of
religious belief and the anthropology of belief I have been thinking
about &lt;a href="http://jonathanmair.com/cultures-of-belief-new-paper-out-in-anthropological-theory/"&gt;for
a while&lt;/a&gt; . They have often squabbled in my head, and in my
imagination, Veyne always wins the argument, so I was curious to see
what Needham would make of Veyne’s argument and the strong implicit
critique of his own position it&amp;nbsp;entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social scientists have a difficult relationship with religious
belief. On the one hand, belief is often absolutely central to accounts
of religious communities and practice: Group A carries out this practice
because of a belief X, religious innovator B used to do Y, so we can
conclude he believed Z, and so on. Such accounts are ubiquitous, in the
everyday language of religious people and non-specialists, &lt;a href="http://jonathanmair.com/evolution-and-religion/"&gt;psychologists of
religion&lt;/a&gt;, and almost just as much, for all their denials, in the
language of social scientists. Because this model of religious life sees
belief-language as being a more or less reliable reflection of religious
people’s understanding of the world, it is known (mainly by its critics)
as&amp;nbsp;‘intellectualism’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, academic students of religion have long argued
that belief is just not what most religious traditions are about, and
that the use of the concept of belief is deeply misleading. I call this
position ‘belief scepticism’. Academic belief scepticism goes back at
least as far as William Robertson Smith’s 1889 &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oAfiFpR7sv8C"&gt;Lectures on the
Religion of the Semites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. There are many variations, but a
general outline of this position is as follows: we modern students of
religion think that religion is all about a set of propositions that
followers believe to be true, but this view of belief as propositional
and central to religious life is a relatively modern Christian
innovation; other religious traditions are more about practice or
symbolic&amp;nbsp;expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This belief scepticism argument has also been extended to
Christianity, for example, by Abby Day, who recently &lt;a href="http://jonathanmair.com/abby-days-believing-in-belonging-review/"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt;
that religion in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, including the that of her Christian
interviewees (not all were Christian), was about social belonging and
morality and not about propositional&amp;nbsp;belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although both intellectualism and belief scepticism have important
things to teach us about religious and other belief, I do not accept
either (1) that religious belief language is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; a
straightforward representation of systematically related propositions to
which followers assent, as the intellectualists are alleged to claim, or
(2) that belief-language &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; has another function (part of
practice, deference to a social system, expression of moral values) and
&lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; refers to propositional beliefs, except perhaps in the
case of (some) Christians, as the belief sceptics often&amp;nbsp;argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long been a proponent of a &lt;a href="http://jonathanmair.com/cultures-of-belief-new-paper-out-in-anthropological-theory/"&gt;third
position&lt;/a&gt;, which I call the ‘ethnographic’ approach to belief—it
might equally be described as ‘historical’. This simply means
recognising that it is not only first order information—’God is three
persons in one substance’, ‘twins are birds’, ‘actions have
consequences’—that varies between persons, cultures, periods of history,
but also the second-order, meta-cognitive information and practices
relating to how one is supposed to relate cognitively and otherwise to
this&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anthropologist and philosopher Rodney Needham wrote a long and
influential book making the belief-sceptic case, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=khWLQgAACAAJ"&gt;Belief, language
and experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (1972). I have always found his arguments in the
book problematic and I’m always surprised by the deference with which
his argument is treated by contemporary&amp;nbsp;anthropologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Veyne is a French historian of classical antiquity, who was
closely associated with Foucault. His 1983 book &lt;em&gt;Les Grecs ont-ils
cru à leurs mythes?&lt;/em&gt;, published in English translation in 1988 as
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EpbZLRPGgBsC"&gt;Did the
Greeks believe in their myths?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is, I think, an exemplary
instance of an ethnographic approach to belief that takes into account
different styles, or ‘modes’ of belief, as much as the content to which
belief was&amp;nbsp;applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His answer to the eponymous question is ‘yes and no’—the ordinary
Greek did not believe in myth in the same way that he believed in things
he had experienced directly, but he still believed that the events
recounted in myths were true. The different modes of truth were
distinguished by different truth&amp;nbsp;conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veyne neatly demonstrates the importance of understanding the
plurality of modes of belief or ‘programmes of truth’ by contrasting the
attitudes of the Greek in the street with those of classical historians
such as Pausanias and Thucydides. The historians no less than hoi polloi
believe the events described by myths were true, but their activity was
motivated by a second-order imperative that insisted that there could
only be one programme of truth. The aim of their practice was to apply
reason, &lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt;, in order to reconcile the apparent
contradictions between &lt;em&gt;mythos—&lt;/em&gt;myths about gods and heroes—and
stories of the contemporary lives of ordinary people&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3176697?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;
(jStor paywall), which I suppose is the main way most anthropologists of
religion have come to know its content too. Asad lavishes praise on
Smith at the beginning of the article—the book is a ‘modern classic’,
and so on—but most of his article is a pretty unrelenting takedown. I
have always taken it for granted that Asad’s precis is a reliable
description of Smith’s position, but now I’ve actually read the book,
I’ve found that the argument is much more subtle, and that many (but not
all) of Asad’s criticisms are&amp;nbsp;unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith begins his book by asking a question that had exercised many
other scholars before him: ‘What is religion?’. However, his answer is
quite original. Religion, he argues, is not a constant feature of human
experience, but a historical phenomenon which, being historical, had a
beginning and has continued to change. As it is changing and
heterogeneous, it sometimes has included things that at other times were
excluded. Therefore attempting to understand ‘religion’ as if it was a
stable thing is bound to be misleading. There is little we can say about
it as a category, except to trace its history, and he therefore calls
for the term to be dropped as an analytical tool&amp;nbsp;altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asad writes that Smith is the first anti-essentialist theorist of
religion, but that’s not all he is, and for me he stands awkwardly
between the essentialists and the anti-essentialists. His account of the
history of the religion concept is in some ways much more wide-ranging
and complex than more recent accounts with which I’m more&amp;nbsp;familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet in his claim that the experience of the transcendent is universal
and in some sense ahistorical, he looks like earlier generations of
anthropologists/sociologists/historians of religion, such as Durkheim
and Frazer, who sought to define religion as a trans-historical
category. And there are precedents, too, for the confessional position
that the true purpose of religious practice is a personal relationship
or encounter with the transcendent, for example, in the work of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Underhill"&gt;Evelyn
Underhill&lt;/a&gt;.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith predicted that sociologists would be uncomfortable with the
idea of building the category of the transcendent into their studies. It
does make me uncomfortable, and my instinct is to seek to historicize
the transcendent—is the transcendent/immanent opposition really
universal, as he assumes? can’t its development be traced? isn’t it
dependent on a certain kind of cosmology?—but the sophistication of
Smith’s writing has certainly made me a bit more open to the
idea….still, if you’ll permit me to mangle a metaphor, I can’t help
feeling that in throwing the bathwater out of the analytical bath, he’s
kept back a bit, mistaking it for a baby. If you see what I&amp;nbsp;mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith argues that religion is a confusing term that is used to refer
to a number of different things. These things are, he says, quite
distinct, but they are conflated as a result of the contemporary
application of the term ‘religion’ to all of them. They are&amp;nbsp;(48f):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) A personal relationship to transcendence, piety&lt;/strong&gt;
(in this sense we say someone is more or less religious than ten years&amp;nbsp;ago)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A system of beliefs, practices, values, or whatever,
extending over time and space&lt;/strong&gt; (in this sense we distinguish one
religion from another)—this can be further analysed into two separate
phenomena: &lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;ideal religion&lt;/strong&gt; of
theologians, seldom if ever realised in life, and &lt;strong&gt;(3)&lt;/strong&gt;
the &lt;strong&gt;messy, human reality&lt;/strong&gt; of&amp;nbsp;sociologists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(4) Religion in general&lt;/strong&gt;, as opposed to other realms
of&amp;nbsp;life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Smith, the most important of all of these is the first, which he
proposes to call ‘faith’. He says that faith—a relationship of
obedience, submission or recognition of the transcendent, is a human
universal. This faith finds expression in practices, art, music,
theology and so on, but they are not it. The phenomena described by (2),
(3), and (4) are, unlike personal faith or piety, historical
developments and are therefore messy, heterogeneous, and without a
stable&amp;nbsp;essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conflation of these four aspects under the rubric of ‘religion’
leads to a number of problems. These problems are not consistently
distinguished by Smith, and the following enumeration may just be my
reading, but I think a passage near the very end of the book, where he
explains that his argument has relevance to religious people, to
students of religion, and for humanity at large, does indicate that he
thinks of them as separate&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 1:&lt;/strong&gt; the religious problem. As a religious
person, Smith thinks that faith, piety, the personal encounter of an
individual with the transcendent, is undermined when people conflate it
with its expression. The result is a focus on contingent externals,
rather than the relationship itself. He doesn’t argue, I think, that the
external expressions of faith is unimportant (this is key to my
disagreement with Asad) but rather that treating them as
&lt;em&gt;religion&lt;/em&gt; may lead people to neglect faith and to become too
attached to specifics that should be seen as accidents of&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 2:&lt;/strong&gt; the sociological problem. As the
meaning of the term ‘religion’ has a history, it is confusing when
applied anachronistically across periods in history, or ethnocentrically
to other cultures, and it should be dropped. For instance, the idea that
religion is distinguished from the secular is distinctively a
characteristic of European religion, because there Christianity came to
dominate, but existed alongside political traditions with classical
roots, which only then were understood as secular. When looking at
specific traditions, such as Buddhism or Islam, we should not look for a
defining essence or genius, but accept that they are ever branching,
heterogeneous, contingent accumulations. When trying to understand the
influence of a religious tradition on an individual follower of that
tradition, we can take into account only those aspects of the tradition
of which the follower is aware, rather than trying to define the essence
of the religion explaining his or her actions in the light of that&amp;nbsp;essence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 3:&lt;/strong&gt; the human problem. Smith suggests
that the reification of religion is the cause of conflict. If we
recognised the universality of the human relationship with
transcendence—that is, of faith—we’d learn to tolerate and appreciate
each other’s concrete expressions of that&amp;nbsp;relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commentary on the census is also very useful. I referred to that
aspect of the work in a &lt;a href="../2012-11-16-evolution-and-religion"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, where I
questioned an evolutionary explanation of religion that relied on data

&lt;em&gt;Believing in Belonging&lt;/em&gt; by Abby&amp;nbsp;Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/berghahn/arrs;jsessionid=1gxhglhhneg0a.victoria" title="Religion and Society: Advances in Research"&gt;Religion and Society:
Advances in Research&lt;/a&gt;, Volume 3, Number 1, 2012 , pp.&amp;nbsp;211-241(31)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Believing in Belonging&lt;/em&gt; is a study based mainly on a series
of interviews conducted in the early 2000s in the north of England.
Suspecting that sociological studies of religious affiliation were
failing to capture something important, Day asked her interviewees
instead about ‘belief’. In the substantive chapters she outlines the
main issues that emerged from these conversations: community and
identity, relations with kin, enduring relations with the dead, the
operation of fate or providence, and the importance of&amp;nbsp;morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting finding relates to a puzzle about contemporary
religious belief. In the 2001 census, which was the first to include a
question on religious identity, 72% of respondents identified themselves
as Christian. This was interpreted jubilantly by many, Day notes, as a
refutation of the secularization thesis. The census was not the first
survey to show that a high proportion of British people continue to
identify themselves as Christian, but it added to a longstanding
sociological puzzle: while a high proportion of people in postwar Europe
are still willing to call themselves Christian, other markers of
religion, such as participation in acts of worship, show a dramatic and
continuing&amp;nbsp;decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two established explanations for this discrepancy. One is
that many of the self-identified Christians are ‘nominal’ Christians,
who identify themselves as Christian if asked, and may attend church for
weddings and funerals, but otherwise do not think twice about belief. On
this interpretation, the high rates of religious identification in
surveys such as the census tell us little or nothing about the decline
of belief in religion. The other explanation, most influentially
advanced by Grace Davie, is that the phenomenon is just another aspect
of the individualization of western societies, in which traditional
communal institutions have lost their authority and people engage with
culture on their own terms. On this view, the fall in church attendance
cannot be taken as evidence of a corresponding loss of belief, rather,
people continue ‘believing without&amp;nbsp;belonging’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day’s research supports neither explanation. She finds that her
interviewees can be divided into ‘theocentrics’, who see a relationship
with God at the center of everything they do, and ‘anthropocentrics’,
who do not. Theocentrics tend to be quite hostile in their evaluation of
anthropocentrics, and vice versa. But the surprising and significant
finding is that the boundaries of these groups do not coincide with the
boundary between those who identify themselves as belonging to a
religion and those who do not. About half of the interviewees who
identified themselves as Christian were ‘anthropocentric’, and many of
those were assertively atheist as well as rejecting the authority of
institutional&amp;nbsp;religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a problem for the ‘believing without belonging’ school,
because it suggests that little can be assumed about people’s acceptance
of religious beliefs on the basis of their self-declared religious
identity. On the other hand, many ‘anthropocentric’ respondents, whether
or not they felt they belonged to a particular religion, did believe
they had experienced ghosts, and that the hand of fate acted in their
lives. This means that neither falling church attendances or even
outright antipathy to religion can be taken as clear evidence of
rationalization of&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day’s own interpretation of her findings is that claiming, or
‘performing’, religious identity through surveys and narratives is a way
of asserting a sort of ascribed cultural heritage, and simultaneously
excluding ethnic others from it. Beliefs about other things—values, the
dead, and so on—are used in the same way to express the importance of
various social relationships, and often to exclude weak groups including
women and children. Day’s ‘neo-Durkheimian’ conclusion is that belief is
ultimately a matter of ‘the social’: ‘believing in&amp;nbsp;belonging’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the detail of Day’s interviews is of interest. For example,
the way in which informants sometimes reveal their own awareness of
having decided to believe that they can speak to their kin beyond the
grave, because the alternative would be unbearable, or the fact that
ghosts are experienced in an embodied, sensually rich way, but rarely
visually, or that among her respondents, only deceased kin were
experienced in this way, not friends or unrelated strangers.
Interviewees say they believe morality is doing to others as one would
be done by, but in practice, they mean ‘doing to’ people like
themselves, and various ethnic, or gendered ‘others’ turn out not to
merit the same treatment. Many ‘anthropocentric’ people say that being
culturally Christian means that their values are based on the Ten
Commandments, and do not notice that they have tacitly edited out
Commandments I – &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt;, which stipulate proper behavior in relation to&amp;nbsp;God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This material alone makes the book a valuable contribution to the
literature. However, in terms of its theoretical aims—to provide a sound
basis for understanding belief—the book is less successful. Day is
ambitious in this respect and there are theoretical claims throughout.
Here space allows me to mention only the most important of them, Day’s
argument (drawing on Austin and Butler) that belief should be understood
as ‘performative’ in the sense that the narration of beliefs brings
about concrete effects. However, the claim is nowhere clearly explained,
and Day’s usage is slippery: sometimes the effect of performance is the
creation of a community of identity or some other object of belief,
sometimes it is the creation of the belief itself, sometimes she seems
to be claiming that the performance &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is the&amp;nbsp;belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that defining ‘belief’ is so important to Day’s
argument—and this is also the reason it is so difficult to define—is
that she seeks to displace the concept of ‘religion’ from its central
position in social scientific work, but seems to want to replace it with
an equivalent concept that covers much the same ground, including fate,
morality and communication with the dead. But there is no reason to
think that the different things the interviewees speak about under the
rubric of ‘belief’ cover, from their point of view, a single field of
thought or activity, and therefore no reason to expect to be able to
find a unifying definition, or even that a family resemblance
relationship obtains between them. Day sets out to replace the survey
designers’ blunt questions about religious affiliation, which assume too
much, with a more inductive approach, but the design of her structured
interviews, starting with the question, ‘What do you believe in?’
incorporates its own assumptions, above all that there is a single,
coherent phenomenon that corresponds to ‘believing in’. Day’s
descriptions of the anxiety evoked in her participants by her first
question—for instance, ‘Sometimes informants demonstrated surprise at
the question and needed a few seconds to gather his or her [sic]
thoughts. Some physically drew back and looked at me in shock…’
(p. 41)—suggest that for them ‘believing in’ corresponded to no clearly
defined or salient&amp;nbsp;category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day has not solved the problem of belief, but notwithstanding these
limitations, her book is an important contribution to the literature
that has significant implications for future empirical and theoretical
work, as well as for public&amp;nbsp;policy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="anthropology"></category><category term="Abby Day"></category><category term="belief"></category><category term="census"></category><category term="Christianity"></category><category term="fate"></category><category term="ghosts"></category><category term="religion"></category><category term="uk"></category></entry><entry><title>Cultures of Belief — post-print version of article</title><link href="https://www.jonathanmair.com/2013-04-10-cultures-of-belief-post-print-version-of-article/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-04-10T16:42:23+02:00</published><updated>2023-06-14T08:32:30+02:00</updated><author><name>Jonathan Mair</name></author><id>tag:www.jonathanmair.com,2013-04-10:/2013-04-10-cultures-of-belief-post-print-version-of-article/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As promised, here’s a post-print version of my Cultures of Belief

version available through this website soon for those who don’t have
access to the journal through an academic&amp;nbsp;library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is titled ‘Cultures of ignorance’. In a nutshell, the
argument is that academic students of religion have settled on a way of
accounting for religious language and thought that distinguishes
ordinary, everyday belief from religious belief. The former is
understood to be literal and practical. The latter, by contrast, is
taken to be indirect, metaphorical, symbolic, affective, moral and so
on, and by implication &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be about propositional belief.
Drawing on my own field research in northern China’s Inner Mongolia, I
argue that there are ways of relating to a body of true knowledge that
fit neither of these models. I argue that in order to understand what is
going on in this situation and many others we need to develop an
ethnographic sensibility to locally specific ‘cultures of belief’. To
get this project off to a start, I suggest some initial building blocks
for a general anthropology of belief, based on religious thought in
ancient Greece, mediaeval Judaism, and contemporary &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Evangelism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the&amp;nbsp;abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In popular thought about the meaning of religion, as well as
established debates in anthropology, religious belief is interpreted as
either a commitment to a clear set of propositions, or as a non-literal,
symbolic, ethical or social commitment. Anthropologists have tended to
support the latter of these positions, so much so that this can now be
seen as the ‘anthropological’ position; it is also characteristic of the
view of scholars in related disciplines, such as religious studies. This
article argues for a third possibility: that religious (and other)
believers are often engaged in complex, reflexive practices that
stipulate specific cognitive and non-cognitive relationships to
propositional content. This is demonstrated with reference to
contemporary Buddhism in Inner Mongolia, China. The author argues that
the existence of such cultures of belief demonstrates there is a need
for a systematic anthropological theory of belief and suggests some
sources that may contribute to its&amp;nbsp;formulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve just read two fascinating papers by &lt;a href="http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/fmb26@cam.ac.uk"&gt;Felicitas
Becker&lt;/a&gt; on moral conflict in East Africa. Both papers describe the
relationship between Islamist reformers and Sufi-influenced
traditionalists in rural Tanzania. Broadly speaking, the Islamists are
young, have international connections (though these are limited), and
their leaders claim legitimacy as a result of their scriptural
scholarship. The traditionalists are drawn from the older generations
and derive their authority from their descent from founders of local
mosques, or from their place in a chain of transmission of oral
knowledge. Most local people, Becker notes, consider themselves Muslims,
but observe the debates between the two groups without feeling the need
to declare themselves partisans of either&amp;nbsp;side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the papers, ‘Islamic Reform and Historical Change in the Care
of the Dead’ (2009) focuses on disagreements between the two parties
around funerary practices, which take on great importance in this
context. Traditionalists have elaborate funerals in which prayers and
the Quran are recited over the funeral procession and the deceased is
read instructions on how to meet the angels after the burial is
complete. To the elders who represent this tradition, these measures
show that they are more punctilious in caring for the dead than their
nomadic forebears who, before the adoption of Islamic usages, would
abandon settlements along with the corpses of the dead. To the
reformists, the intercessions on behalf of, and interaction with, the
deceased are accretions that are not justified by Quran or Hadith and
must therefore be&amp;nbsp;relinquished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other paper, ‘Rural Islamism during the “War on Terror”‘ (2006)
considers a wider range of disagreements over practice, and also
addresses the question of how far the reformers, who are nicknamed by
other ‘Al Qaeda’, are in fact part of a coherent ‘international terror’
movement. Becker’s admirably nuanced conclusion, if I understand it
correctly, is that although they are politically activist in theory, and
in a way that could potentially lead to violent conflict, the political
plank of their programme finds no traction with local concerns and is
therefore barely a live part of their practice, while the international
connections are tenuous. Meanwhile, the other aspect of their programme,
the claim that scriptural scholarship is the sole source of religious
legitimacy has found great support among the population, and even
grudging assent among those who find themselves on the opposite side of
debates about specific practices. This aspect of Becker’s material makes
it interesting in terms of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRASSH&lt;/span&gt; Speaking Ethically Across Borders&amp;nbsp;Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-morality-system-and-literacy"&gt;The ‘morality system’ and&amp;nbsp;literacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2006 paper, Becker&amp;nbsp;notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…the opinions expounded by &lt;em&gt;Ansaar&lt;/em&gt; [the reformists/Islamists]
consistently tend towards the imposition of stricter rules. They are
more concerned than others about the loss of ritual purity through
contact with the opposite sex; they support a ban on alcohol and have
suggested that smoking, too, is &lt;em&gt;haram&lt;/em&gt;, religiously prohibited.
… They have also introduced new forms of veiling to Rwangwa, have
changed standards for &lt;em&gt;halal&lt;/em&gt; (religiously correct) slaughter and
have questioned the acceptability of established ways of dealing with
witchcraft. (Becker 2006:&amp;nbsp;594)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me think about the relation of literacy and forms of
ethics. Much recent anthropological work on ethics has taken on a
distinction from philosophy between virtue ethics and what Bernard
Williams calls the ‘morality system’. The morality system is about
judgment of acts against legalistic codes of behaviour, lists of
obligations and taboos, and it leads to a concern with the refinement of
rules for particular circumstances, and with moral dilemmas. Virtue
ethics is about the judgment of character against models of excellence,
and leads to a concern with the identification of exemplars, and with
pedagogical techniques that lead to the cultivation of particular
virtues (including what Foucault calls ‘techniques of the&amp;nbsp;self’).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of anthropological work on Islamic reformists has emphasised
the way in which their reforms are connected to virtue ethical
programmes of character development, but I wonder if there’s a general
relationship between reformist movements that base legitimacy on
scriptural sources and the importance of the ‘morality system’.
Character-based ethics requires a good deal of interpretation in order
to work out how an exemplar would act in the current situation (see
Humphrey 1997 on this). Virtues that are partly or mainly about embodied
dispositions are apt to be expressed in imagistic forms that
underdetermine their expression (Carrithers 1990). Is it difficult to
combine this interpretative flexibility and the autonomy it implies with
an insistence on submission to scripture as a sole source of&amp;nbsp;authority?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Becker’s Tanzanian case study, the traditionalist elders apply
this kind of reasoning to the conduct of funerals. The reformists argue
from scripture&amp;nbsp;that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet, peace be upon him, prohibits the corpse [to be sung to],
that is to say, when we get up to go to the graveyard to bury someone,
we are required to be quiet and to ponder that our fellow Muslim has
died and we will die too. Therefore we must be quiet. And the Prophet
says don’t follow the hearse with any sort of noise, let people be quiet
and reflect. (Becker 2006:&amp;nbsp;592)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sufis’ riposte is&amp;nbsp;that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days of the prophet, the graves were situated very close to
the houses of the liv- ing. But our graves are far from our villages.
Moreover, our faith is not as strong as that of the first Muslims. Were
we to go to the graveyard in silence, our thoughts might start to wander
and some might start to discuss, say, football on the way to the grave!
So our elders decided we had better recite the shahada on the way to the
grave, to keep our minds&amp;nbsp;focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could, I think, be interpreted as a more character-based
approach to ethics. Though the traditionalists accept the idea that
scripture, and not established custom, is the proper arbiter of
practice, they maintain enough autonomy from it to interpret it in the
light of specific local and personal conditions. Perhaps this shows that
they are more concerned with emulating the underlying character
expressed by the Prophet’s actions, something that can never be entirely
captured in words, because it is always contextual, rather than
reproducing the actions, which can be more precisely described in the
text,&amp;nbsp;themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to reach a conclusion on this question on the basis of
this material alone, but perhaps a comparative approach would turn up a
regular association between text-based revival movements
(i.e. renaissances — Goody 2009), and a shift away from a concern with
character and towards a concern with moral rules. Or the shift might be
away from a complex character approach, with multiple, perhaps mutually
incompatible, virtues or exemplars available to the moral subject,
towards a simpler character approach which focuses all effort on the
single virtue of perfect submission to the authority of the&amp;nbsp;text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael — Thanks for the links (reproduced below) and for engaging

&lt;p&gt;I’ve read those two papers now –they are thought provoking and
contain some great lines (“evolutionary theorists brought up far more
scientific arguments — but committed believers in supernatural agents
brought up far more children”–love it!), but I don’t think they really
answer my initial&amp;nbsp;objection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On page 118 of the Reproductive Benefits paper, you write (I’ve added
emphasis and labels in square&amp;nbsp;brackets):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;” [1] Religiosity, understood as *believing* in supernatural guidance
and surveillance of all parties involved, evolved (and evolves) as a
biological and highly successful solution. [2] Humans who are *members*
of religious communities show statistically higher motivations towards
marriage, children and family values, more cooperative orientation and
finally higher reproductive success than their secular&amp;nbsp;contemporaries”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am questioning is the relation between religiosity as defined
in [1] and the membership of religious communities referred to in [2].
You draw conclusions about ‘religiosity’ (i.e., belief, on your
definition — I’ll use this word with that force from now on) on the
basis of data about religious affiliation, taking the latter to be
indicative of the former. It is clear from the social scientific
literature on religion that the link between these things is uncertain
to say the&amp;nbsp;least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this in any way invalidates your observations about religious
&lt;em&gt;communities&lt;/em&gt; and reproduction. But if I am right the following
objections&amp;nbsp;follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="over-interpretation-of-the-data"&gt;1. Over-interpretation of the&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be over-interpreting the census data in making the leap from
affiliation to traditional communities with religious associations to
religiosity, on your terms. (I am dubious about the methodology of the
World Values Survey for many of the same reasons by the way, but it’s a
long time since I’ve looked at it so I can’t comment in&amp;nbsp;detail.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave Day’s study as an example in my post because her work directly
addresses the difference between people’s ‘superempirical’ behaviour and
thought and their response to questions about religious affiliation in a
national&amp;nbsp;census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the question of the discrepancy between belief and
affiliation has been a constant theme in social scientific studies of
religion since at least the end of the 19C and the work of William
Robertson Smith (ref&amp;nbsp;below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this question is of enduring interest is that it confounds
the expectations of modern models of religion that are basically
Protestant or post-reformation in nature, especially the expectation
that religion is above all about a personal, interior relationship to
God and the holy, that a particular tradition of worship is associated
with particular institutions and so on. Even in countries (such as the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;) where this model might be expected to apply most strongly (because
for centuries it has been a model of what religion &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be
like), ethnographic work (such as Day’s) shows consistently that the
boundaries between beliefs and boundaries between religious affiliation
are frequently do not line up in the way the model would&amp;nbsp;predict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="anachronism"&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;Anachronism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it were shown that the association between religious
affiliation and religious belief were sound for modern populations, your
conclusions project this combination back throughout history and
prehistory. If we didn’t know anything about changing configurations of
religious behaviour, then that might be a reasonable move. However,
there’s plenty of evidence that the idea of a discrete religion that
comprises a combination of {(i) an exclusive, systematic religious
doctrine + (ii) exclusive use of certain religious practices + (iii) a
specific and exclusive religious affiliation} is a relatively recent
invention that is even now by no means the norm, and which requires a
great deal of policing to make sure that people defined by any one of
these characteristics are also defined by the other&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you have evidence that contradicts the consensus in the
literature, then explaining the evolutionary origins and persistence of
religiosity throughout human existence in terms of the reproductive
advantage it bestows on religious communities may be like seeking the
explanation for the origins and persistence of language over 100s of
thousands of years in terms of its essential role in hip hop. Doing this
would not only misrepresent the nature of language over the long term,
it would also make hip-hop seem like a universal and transhistorical&amp;nbsp;phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By eliding the difference between religious affiliation and religious
belief, and drawing the conclusion that the combination is an
evolutionary adaptation, you give the impression that religion in this
sense is universal and&amp;nbsp;transhistorical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t, by the way, have any axe to grind (some social scientists
do) whatsoever on the question of human universals — I think it’s
obvious that there is such a thing as human nature and that we ought to
try to understand it, but it’s important that in doing that we do take
into account everything we know about human&amp;nbsp;variation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt; 5 Dec 2012: Don’t know anything about the quality/provenance

days, people seem to rush to evolutionary explanations for all sorts of
real and perceived human behaviours. The danger of doing this is that in
going straight to the question of the origins of what we’re trying to
understand, we fail to put in the effort to adequately study the nature
of the phenomenon, or even to establish satisfactorily that the
phenomenon is real. As a result, it’s all too easy for commonsensical
assumptions and misapprehensions to get incorporated into the story. And
when it comes to human behaviour, things are often more complicated and
more variable than common sense would lead us to&amp;nbsp;expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="its-probably-about-affiliation-and-endogamy-michael"&gt;It’s
probably about affiliation and endogamy,&amp;nbsp;Michael!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a particularly common problem, in my view, in evolutionary
studies of religion, and I’ve just read a blog post that’s a case in
point. In &lt;a href="http://www.scilogs.com/nature-of-faith/its-about-fertility-stupid-the-evolutionary-adaptivity-of-religion/"&gt;It’s
about Fertility, stupid! The Evolutionary Adaptivity of Religion&lt;/a&gt;’,
Michael Blume claims&amp;nbsp;that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religiosity (defined as behavior towards superempircal agents) is
today clearly adaptive: Members of competitive religious communities are
building stronger families with more offspring worldwide as their
secular neighbours of the same education and income levels. This is
observable in empirical studies, censusses worldwide, as well as in case
studies (i.e. Amish, Hutterites, Mormons, Orthodox Jews). In contrast,
non-religious populations and those religious communities who do not
build and support families inevitably succumb to cultural evolution
(i.e. late Greek and Roman Polytheism, Gnostic groups, the Shakers) and
are replaced by demographically successful religious&amp;nbsp;competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blume’s interpretation of the empirical data depends on the premise
that affiliation to these groups as revealed in, say, censuses, is a
reliable indicator of religiosity, on his definition. But there is a
good deal of social scientific evidence that shows that this cannot be
taken for&amp;nbsp;granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give just one example, a great study of belief in contemporary
northern England published last year by Abby Day (&lt;a href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/ReligionTheology/SociologyofReligion/?view=usa&amp;amp;ci=9780199577873"&gt;Believing
in Belonging&lt;/a&gt;) shows that ideas about belonging and ideas about the
supernatural can be surprisingly independent of each&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years now, church attendance in Britain has been in decline, and
sociologists have debated what this means. Some argued it was a sign of
‘secularization’–an inevitable loss of religious belief associated with
the modernization and rationalization of society. Others argued that it
was a result of individualization, and that Britons continued to believe
in God, but now preferred to practise their religion quietly on their&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day’s study, which was based on interviews in Yorkshire villages,
found a more complex picture. Her interviewees turned out to be quite
polarized in their views. Some of them–she calls them
‘theocentrics’–place God at the centre of their lives, as a source of
moral value, a cause of everyday events, and an object of their
attention and affections. Others–Day calls these ‘anthropocentrics’–see
no place for God, and instead locate value and meaning in their
relationships with other humans. Anthropocentrics take a dim view of
theocentrism and vice&amp;nbsp;versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An everyday story of small town intolerance, then, and perhaps no
surprise. So why did Day not just call her two groups ‘religious’, and
‘secularists’ instead of inventing two new terms? Well, it turned out
that of the respondents who identified themselves as Christian, about
half were anthropocentric, and many of those were assertively atheist.
Many of those self-identified Christians said they were hostile to the
idea of institutional&amp;nbsp;religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, many of those who identified with no religion told Day
that they prayed, believed in fate or some kind of providence, had seen
ghosts or had communicated with deceased&amp;nbsp;relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his article, Blume mentions that his work was partly based on
census data. It’s worth noting that most of Day’s Christians, including
the ‘anthropocentric’ atheists, said that they had answered ‘Christian’
in response to the religious affiliation question in the 2001 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; census
(the first modern &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; census to include a religion&amp;nbsp;question).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day’s work shows that being associated with, or feeling a sense of
identity and belonging in respect of, a ‘religious community’ is quite a
different thing to ‘religiosity (defined as behavior towards
superempircal agents)’. Religiosity is neither exclusive to, nor
universal among, members of ‘competitive religious&amp;nbsp;communities’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, unless the empirical data are sufficient to distinguish
between belonging and believing, there is no reason to suppose that
religiosity, on Blume’s definition, has anything to do with the
increased reproductive success Blume finds for religious communities
through&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there is a simpler explanation at hand. Many of the
historical and contemporary religious groups that we identify as such
combine a self-conscious sense of identity with a greater or lesser
degree of endogamy (marriage within the group) and they tend to value
having and bringing up children and the relationships between kin. It
would not be surprising if this combination of features were to lead to
reproductive&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blume himself inadvertently suggests this explanation when he
excludes from his analysis ‘those religious communities who do not build
and support families … (i.e. late Greek and Roman Polytheism, Gnostic
groups, the&amp;nbsp;Shakers)’.&lt;/p&gt;
