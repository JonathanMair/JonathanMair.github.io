&lt;p&gt;the fundamental questions remains: Why are only “religious”
communities able to augment this in-group cooperation not, say,
political parties or sport&amp;nbsp;clubs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly an interesting question, and one that is not
affected by the objections in my previous post, but I do have some
reservations on this count&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="comparing-like-with-like"&gt;1. Comparing like with&amp;nbsp;like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can address the question, we need to make sure we’re
comparing like with like. From your &lt;a href="http://www.scilogs.com/nature-of-faith/its-about-fertility-stupid-the-evolutionary-adaptivity-of-religion/"&gt;original
post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found many religious traditions that were able to attain high
levels of fertility throughout the generations. But in sharp empirical
contrast, we didn’t find a single non-religious community, movement or
population that was able to retain at least replacement level (two
births per woman) for a&amp;nbsp;century!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way you put this explicitly rules out any kind of organization
that is not involved in baby making (“two births per woman”). That’s
fair enough, as you’re interested in evolution, which ultimately depends
on differential reproductive advantage. But doing this also means that
you cannot legitimately take such organizations as sports clubs as
secular equivalents of religious groups in your comparisons. Of course
tennis clubs can’t achieve two births per woman — they don’t (as far as
I know) admit members by birth! This has no necessary or causal relation
to&amp;nbsp;religiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 205px"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.medals.org.uk/mongolia/mongolia020.htm"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mongolian Medal: ‘Aldart Ekh’ – Renowned Mother, First Class" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.medals.org.uk/mongolia/images/mongolia028.jpg?resize=205%2C250" title="Mongolian Medal: 'Aldart Ekh' -- Renowned Mother, First Class"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;
Mongolian Medal: ‘Aldart Ekh’ — Renowned Mother, First Class
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a comparison in terms of replacement by birth — the
comparison that would allow us to reach the conclusion that religious
communities have an advantage over non-religious ones in terms of
reproduction — &lt;strong&gt;we’d have to find non-religious organizations
that *did* base membership at least in part on reproduction and&amp;nbsp;birth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to non-reproduction related groups such as sports clubs
and political parties, it is hard to think of many examples. Why that
should be the case is an interesting question in itself — I’ll consider
that&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some modernist nationalisms (especially those allied to
eugenic policies?), or ethnic groups without strong religious
affiliation (some national minorities in China?) would fit the&amp;nbsp;bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are good examples of the former — I’m thinking especially of
the Hero Mother campaigns in the Soviet Union and other Communist
countries, and these did achieve very high birth rates. Some people have
argued that Stalinism had religious characteristics — maybe so, but it
was certainly not interested in non-empirical agents
(i.e. ‘religiosity’, in your terms). When I first went to Ulanbaatar in
2002, many people still proudly declared themselves ‘materialist’ when I
asked them about religion! These national movements really did achieve
huge population growth. Admittedly, it was not sustained over much more
than two&amp;nbsp;generations….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-historical-question"&gt;2. The historical&amp;nbsp;question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…Which brings us to my second reservation: the historical depth, or
lack of it, of non-religious&amp;nbsp;organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were going to make a generalization about the relative
reproductive success of religious and non-religious communities, one
that is to hold good across evolutionary time, we would need to have a
decent number of examples of both kinds of&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are good reasons to think it is impossible to find a sufficient
sample of non-religious, membership-by-reproduction&amp;nbsp;communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason is the historical novelty of secularism. The idea of
having communities or institutions that exclude religiosity (on your
definition) simply does not have a long history. It is an idea that had
its origins in the Enlightenment or the development of the nation state
(see Talal Asad, Charles Taylor — refs&amp;nbsp;below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more general account might give a role to the modern phenomenon of
‘purification’. Early anthropologists were fascinated by the fact that
the institutions they studied among ‘natives’ in colonial contexts
around the world could not be pigeonholed into one of the major
categories that we use to understand modern society, such as politics,
economics, kinship, religion and so on. For example, an annual meeting
between villages might involve arrangements for marriages (kinship),
exchanges of goods (economics), offerings to ancestors (religion), and
alliances (politics). Marcel Mauss called this a total&amp;nbsp;institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, modern societies are characterized by an attempt to
purify institutions so that they only perform one kind of role…if your
economic institution also performs kinship functions, that’s called
nepotism! If your political institution performs commercial functions,
corruption! Bruno Latour has argued that this work of purification is
more rhetorical than&amp;nbsp;actual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the evidence seems to suggest that secular communities in
general were either very rare or non-existent (on a broad or narrow
definition of secularism, respectively) until the modern
period.&lt;/strong&gt; This explanation accounts parsimoniously for your being
unable to find any long-lived communities defined by their exclusion of
religion throughout history — there simply weren’t any such communities
until relatively&amp;nbsp;recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the lack of longstanding communities of this kind were instead
down to relative reproductive disadvantage, am I wrong in thinking that
we should see a long history of ephemeral secular birth-related
communities that die out quickly? Can you name any one such community
dating to before 1600? The examples you give of communities that did not
prosper are defined by their &lt;em&gt;religious&lt;/em&gt; characteristics — they
don’t appear to be secular in any sense (Shakers, ancient&amp;nbsp;Pagans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it may be too soon to say whether secular birth-related
communities will prove to be successful. It may continue to be difficult
to say: the reason such communities are &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; likely to be rare
may be that the modern practice of purification that I outlined above
tends to militate against birth/kinship functions being mixed up with
other functions. Such a mixture would be a necessary condition of
recognizing a community as anything other than a kinship&amp;nbsp;group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my reservations about comparisons before the modern period and
comparisons are justified, then what remains to be explained is the
apparent reproductive advantage of religiously defined groups over other
groups &lt;em&gt;in the modern period&lt;/em&gt; — accepting your example of
Switzerland as representative and unproblematic. The relation of this
phenomenon to religiosity, on your definition, was the subject of my
previous two&amp;nbsp;posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael — Thanks for the links (reproduced below) and for engaging
with my&amp;nbsp;comment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read those two papers now –they are thought provoking and
contain some great lines (“evolutionary theorists brought up far more
scientific arguments — but committed believers in supernatural agents
brought up far more children”–love it!), but I don’t think they really
answer my initial&amp;nbsp;objection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On page 118 of the Reproductive Benefits paper, you write (I’ve added
emphasis and labels in square&amp;nbsp;brackets):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;” [1] Religiosity, understood as *believing* in supernatural guidance
and surveillance of all parties involved, evolved (and evolves) as a
biological and highly successful solution. [2] Humans who are *members*
of religious communities show statistically higher motivations towards
marriage, children and family values, more cooperative orientation and
finally higher reproductive success than their secular&amp;nbsp;contemporaries”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am questioning is the relation between religiosity as defined
in [1] and the membership of religious communities referred to in [2].
You draw conclusions about ‘religiosity’ (i.e., belief, on your
definition — I’ll use this word with that force from now on) on the
basis of data about religious affiliation, taking the latter to be
indicative of the former. It is clear from the social scientific
literature on religion that the link between these things is uncertain
to say the&amp;nbsp;least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this in any way invalidates your observations about religious
&lt;em&gt;communities&lt;/em&gt; and reproduction. But if I am right the following
objections&amp;nbsp;follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="over-interpretation-of-the-data"&gt;1. Over-interpretation of the&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be over-interpreting the census data in making the leap from
affiliation to traditional communities with religious associations to
religiosity, on your terms. (I am dubious about the methodology of the
World Values Survey for many of the same reasons by the way, but it’s a
long time since I’ve looked at it so I can’t comment in&amp;nbsp;detail.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave Day’s study as an example in my post because her work directly
addresses the difference between people’s ‘superempirical’ behaviour and
thought and their response to questions about religious affiliation in a
national&amp;nbsp;census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the question of the discrepancy between belief and
affiliation has been a constant theme in social scientific studies of
religion since at least the end of the 19C and the work of William
Robertson Smith (ref&amp;nbsp;below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this question is of enduring interest is that it confounds
the expectations of modern models of religion that are basically
Protestant or post-reformation in nature, especially the expectation
that religion is above all about a personal, interior relationship to
God and the holy, that a particular tradition of worship is associated
with particular institutions and so on. Even in countries (such as the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;) where this model might be expected to apply most strongly (because
for centuries it has been a model of what religion &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be
like), ethnographic work (such as Day’s) shows consistently that the
boundaries between beliefs and boundaries between religious affiliation
are frequently do not line up in the way the model would&amp;nbsp;predict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="anachronism"&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;Anachronism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it were shown that the association between religious
affiliation and religious belief were sound for modern populations, your
conclusions project this combination back throughout history and
prehistory. If we didn’t know anything about changing configurations of
religious behaviour, then that might be a reasonable move. However,
there’s plenty of evidence that the idea of a discrete religion that
comprises a combination of {(i) an exclusive, systematic religious
doctrine + (ii) exclusive use of certain religious practices + (iii) a
specific and exclusive religious affiliation} is a relatively recent
invention that is even now by no means the norm, and which requires a
great deal of policing to make sure that people defined by any one of
these characteristics are also defined by the other&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you have evidence that contradicts the consensus in the
literature, then explaining the evolutionary origins and persistence of
religiosity throughout human existence in terms of the reproductive
advantage it bestows on religious communities may be like seeking the
explanation for the origins and persistence of language over 100s of
thousands of years in terms of its essential role in hip hop. Doing this
would not only misrepresent the nature of language over the long term,
it would also make hip-hop seem like a universal and transhistorical&amp;nbsp;phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By eliding the difference between religious affiliation and religious
belief, and drawing the conclusion that the combination is an
evolutionary adaptation, you give the impression that religion in this
sense is universal and&amp;nbsp;transhistorical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t, by the way, have any axe to grind (some social scientists
do) whatsoever on the question of human universals — I think it’s
obvious that there is such a thing as human nature and that we ought to
try to understand it, but it’s important that in doing that we do take
into account everything we know about human&amp;nbsp;variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come!…&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href="http://jonathanmair.com/evolution-and-religion-part-iii/" title="Evolution and Religion Part III"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These articles by Talal Asad criticise the tendency of other

days, people seem to rush to evolutionary explanations for all sorts of
real and perceived human behaviours. The danger of doing this is that in
going straight to the question of the origins of what we’re trying to
understand, we fail to put in the effort to adequately study the nature
of the phenomenon, or even to establish satisfactorily that the
phenomenon is real. As a result, it’s all too easy for commonsensical
assumptions and misapprehensions to get incorporated into the story. And
when it comes to human behaviour, things are often more complicated and
more variable than common sense would lead us to&amp;nbsp;expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="its-probably-about-affiliation-and-endogamy-michael"&gt;It’s
probably about affiliation and endogamy,&amp;nbsp;Michael!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a particularly common problem, in my view, in evolutionary
studies of religion, and I’ve just read a blog post that’s a case in
point. In &lt;a href="http://www.scilogs.com/nature-of-faith/its-about-fertility-stupid-the-evolutionary-adaptivity-of-religion/"&gt;It’s
about Fertility, stupid! The Evolutionary Adaptivity of Religion&lt;/a&gt;’,
Michael Blume claims&amp;nbsp;that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religiosity (defined as behavior towards superempircal agents) is
today clearly adaptive: Members of competitive religious communities are
building stronger families with more offspring worldwide as their
secular neighbours of the same education and income levels. This is
observable in empirical studies, censusses worldwide, as well as in case
studies (i.e. Amish, Hutterites, Mormons, Orthodox Jews). In contrast,
non-religious populations and those religious communities who do not
build and support families inevitably succumb to cultural evolution
(i.e. late Greek and Roman Polytheism, Gnostic groups, the Shakers) and
are replaced by demographically successful religious&amp;nbsp;competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blume’s interpretation of the empirical data depends on the premise
that affiliation to these groups as revealed in, say, censuses, is a
reliable indicator of religiosity, on his definition. But there is a
good deal of social scientific evidence that shows that this cannot be
taken for&amp;nbsp;granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give just one example, a great study of belief in contemporary
northern England published last year by Abby Day (&lt;a href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/ReligionTheology/SociologyofReligion/?view=usa&amp;amp;ci=9780199577873"&gt;Believing
in Belonging&lt;/a&gt;) shows that ideas about belonging and ideas about the
supernatural can be surprisingly independent of each&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years now, church attendance in Britain has been in decline, and
sociologists have debated what this means. Some argued it was a sign of
‘secularization’–an inevitable loss of religious belief associated with
the modernization and rationalization of society. Others argued that it
was a result of individualization, and that Britons continued to believe
in God, but now preferred to practise their religion quietly on their&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day’s study, which was based on interviews in Yorkshire villages,
found a more complex picture. Her interviewees turned out to be quite
polarized in their views. Some of them–she calls them
‘theocentrics’–place God at the centre of their lives, as a source of
moral value, a cause of everyday events, and an object of their
attention and affections. Others–Day calls these ‘anthropocentrics’–see
no place for God, and instead locate value and meaning in their
relationships with other humans. Anthropocentrics take a dim view of
theocentrism and vice&amp;nbsp;versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An everyday story of small town intolerance, then, and perhaps no
surprise. So why did Day not just call her two groups ‘religious’, and
‘secularists’ instead of inventing two new terms? Well, it turned out
that of the respondents who identified themselves as Christian, about
half were anthropocentric, and many of those were assertively atheist.
Many of those self-identified Christians said they were hostile to the
idea of institutional&amp;nbsp;religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, many of those who identified with no religion told Day
that they prayed, believed in fate or some kind of providence, had seen
ghosts or had communicated with deceased&amp;nbsp;relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his article, Blume mentions that his work was partly based on
census data. It’s worth noting that most of Day’s Christians, including
the ‘anthropocentric’ atheists, said that they had answered ‘Christian’
in response to the religious affiliation question in the 2001 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; census
(the first modern &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; census to include a religion&amp;nbsp;question).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day’s work shows that being associated with, or feeling a sense of
identity and belonging in respect of, a ‘religious community’ is quite a
different thing to ‘religiosity (defined as behavior towards
superempircal agents)’. Religiosity is neither exclusive to, nor
universal among, members of ‘competitive religious&amp;nbsp;communities’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, unless the empirical data are sufficient to distinguish
between belonging and believing, there is no reason to suppose that
religiosity, on Blume’s definition, has anything to do with the
increased reproductive success Blume finds for religious communities
through&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there is a simpler explanation at hand. Many of the
historical and contemporary religious groups that we identify as such
combine a self-conscious sense of identity with a greater or lesser
degree of endogamy (marriage within the group) and they tend to value
having and bringing up children and the relationships between kin. It
would not be surprising if this combination of features were to lead to
reproductive&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blume himself inadvertently suggests this explanation when he
excludes from his analysis ‘those religious communities who do not build
and support families … (i.e. late Greek and Roman Polytheism, Gnostic
groups, the&amp;nbsp;Shakers)’.&lt;/p&gt;
