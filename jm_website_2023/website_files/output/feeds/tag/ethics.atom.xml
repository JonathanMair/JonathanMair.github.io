&lt;p&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen a dramatic growth in the study of ethics among
social anthropologists. Much of this growth has been due to the
assimilation into anthropological thinking of virtue ethics building on
two streams of theoretical work: that of Foucault, and that of virtue
ethicists working in the Anglo-Saxon philosophical tradition. Proponents
of the virtue-ethics approach in anthropology argue that a focus on
self-cultivation as a process allows for sufficient attention to be paid
to self-conscious reflection. Reflection and the freedom it entails,
they argue, are essential aspects of ethical life that traditional
social scientific approaches to ethics – Durkheimian approaches – simply&amp;nbsp;ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There appears to remain an area of ethical experience, however, that
neither approach can easily accommodate. Since virtue ethics sees
ethical judgment as the result of cultivation within a self-conscious
ethical tradition, it can no more account for ethical judgment outside
of or between traditions than the Durkheimian approach can. Yet history
is full of situations in which multiple, self-conscious ethical
traditions meet, and in which people try to judge each other, persuade
each other, or draw lessons from each other across the borders that
separate those traditions. These situations are what we call ‘speaking
ethically across borders’, and this is the phenomenon that the
conference will aim to&amp;nbsp;explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these situations, are people limited to using values with which
they are already familiar to interpret and judge other values? Or can
they genuinely learn from alternative ethical systems? If so, on what
conditions does this process depend? Is the capacity for or disposition
towards a cosmopolitan attitude to ethics itself a culturally specific
norm or a virtue to be perfected, or is it a necessary aspect of ethical
thought? Ethnographically speaking, how have people in fact used the
intellectual resources provided by one ethical tradition to judge
others? How have they sought to borrow from other traditions, or to
persuade followers of other traditions to adopt novel values and
practices? What meta-ethics have specific traditions proposed to govern
the relationship of members of the tradition to the mores of other&amp;nbsp;traditions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday saw the first of a series of reading groups that I’m
organizing at &lt;a href="http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRASSH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the
subject of &lt;a href="../2012-12-07-crassh-project-speaking-ethically-across-borders" title="CRASSH Project: Speaking Ethically Across Borders"&gt;ethical
conversations across borders&lt;/a&gt;. There will be four sessions this term,
each dealing with a different theme, taking in readings from
anthropology, sociology, philosophy and&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first session, on &lt;em&gt;rooted cosmopolitanisms&lt;/em&gt;, was based on
texts by philosopher Martha Nussbaum and sociologist Bryan&amp;nbsp;Turner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cosmopolitanism is perhaps most frequently used to describe the flows
of people and goods between geographically remote regions. Following
this usage, a ‘cosmopolitan’ is someone who moves with facility between
different regions or cultures. However, the term cosmopolitan is also
used with an ethical force. In this sense, it is the idea that ethical
considerations ought not be limited by geographical boundaries. An
ethical cosmopolitan claims that all persons are equally significant
moral beings, no matter where they are located or where they have come
from. On this view, any ethical attachment for members of one’s own
ethnic group or nation or religion is exercised at the expense of&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a position that Nussbaum has defended &lt;a href="http://faculty.capebretonu.ca/philosophy/301/pdfs/1%20Patriotism.pdf"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;.
However, in the paper we discussed in the reading group, ’&lt;a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/daed.2008.137.3.78"&gt;Toward
a globally sensitive patriotism&lt;/a&gt;‘ (paywall), she argues that although
the classical conception of cosmopolitanism, which appeals to reason
alone, is right and desirable, it is in incapable of motivating people
and cannot therefore be the basis of an effective politics. What local,
particularistic accounts can provide, which cosmopolitanism, she says,
cannot, is a rich background of historical events, experiences of
landscapes and particular personalities that can play effectively on the&amp;nbsp;emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nussbaum distinguishes between two forms of love of country. One
form, which she calls patriotism, is focused on leading the subject to
think beyond the self to the good of something greater. Though it
entails particularistic attachments that can come at the cost of global
obligations, Nussbaum believes that patriotism is compatible with
cosmopolitanism and that through its repertoire of local, historically
rich narratives it is capable of evoking altruistic feelings that can be
extended beyond the nation. She gives several examples of patriotic
rhetoric that she believes achieves this goal of harnessing the horse of
visceral attachment to the particular to the carriage of tolerance and
compassion. These include speeches by Martin Luther King and Gandhi,
among&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other form of love of country Nussbaum calls nationalism, this is
based on exclusion of others, and works with shame and disgust.
Nationalism in this sense is incompatible with&amp;nbsp;cosmopolitanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner’s paper, ’&lt;a href="http://tcs.sagepub.com/content/19/1-2/45.short"&gt;Cosmopolitan
Virtue&lt;/a&gt;‘ (paywall) addresses the problem of human rights. Human
rights are problematic for a number of reasons, including that their
advocates can provide no grounds on which the obligations that must
correspond to rights (i.e. the obligation not to encroach on rights, the
obligation to redress the denial of rights, and so on) might be based.
Turner aims to rescue rights by proposing a cosmopolitan virtue which
would form the basis of such&amp;nbsp;obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Nussbaum, Turner thinks that a reason-only approach would prove
ineffective, writing, ‘The idea of global citizenship is probably too
abstract and vague to carry conviction and commitment’ (p. 49). The
solution he proposes harks back to an idea of citizenship that predates
the modern nation-state: ‘…citizenship was originally a product of
Renaissance humanism, in which the ascending order of the state and the
horizontal ordering of citizenship contrasted with the descending theme
of the Church and its hierarchical order of institutionalized grace…
This tradition of citizenship became linked to the norms of civility,
civilization and civil society.’ Becoming a citizen in this sense was a
matter of cultivating virtues, a matter of education or formation. The
virtues were universal ones, but they were learnt in a particular form
and in relation to specific political institutions and traditions. This
is the kind of cosmopolitan virtue that Turner thinks can provide the
obligation that is missing from human rights theory, a virtue that is
based in specific attachments and can therefore command people’s
emotions, but which is aimed at universal goods and avoids exclusion.
The virtues he has in mind emerge as conditions of political debate and
trade, but extend from politeness to care for the&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner also makes a number of other interesting points, in particular
in relation to the universality of the rejection of suffering (a
questionable idea, I think), and about the relation between
cosmopolitanism and irony, but I won’t go into those&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the question of ethical conversations across borders, I
think the most interesting aspects of these papers&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The combination of empirical and rationalist approaches. Both
Nussbaum and Turner are committed to a universalist ethics that they see
as being based on reason, but argue that for practical reasons this must
be combined with contingent ethical forms that are necessarily local and
historical. One can imagine other thinkers arriving in the same place
from the opposite direction: a commitment to an empirical approach to
ethics based on actual custom and precedent, a commitment that needs to
be laid aside in international contexts in favour of a first-principles
approach because there is an insufficient body of shared custom among
parties who transact at that&amp;nbsp;level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Their arguments raise the question of the spatial relationship of
global ethics and local ethics. Is the cosmopolitan to conceive of
global ethics (i) as being beyond space, something that applies at all
times and in all places where moral persons happen to be, (ii) as being
related to the planet earth as a place, just as local ethics are related
to local places, or (iii) in relation to cosmopolitan spaces such as
international cities, pilgrimage sites, universities and so on, where
citizens of a number of different local polities meet and rub along
together? Neither author really answers this question, though Turner
does talk about the importance of cosmopolitan cities in the development
of cosmopolitan virtue, especially in relation to the ironic detachment
from one’s own tradition that he sees as essential to cosmopolitanism.
Perhaps the aim of Nussbaum’s patriotism is to lead from (i) to (ii)?
Perhaps that would depend on the emergence of prominent participatory
political institutions at the global level. Will the increasing
importance of international cities lead from (i) to (iii), or from (iii)
to (ii)? This issue — the location of the global — is relevant to any
scheme that attempts to connect local and universal ethical&amp;nbsp;considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

across a passage that is related to my recent argument about the
problems of the use of the concept of neoliberalism in&amp;nbsp;anthropology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my argument was that academic advocates of neoliberalism and
academic critics of it share a view of the world, for all their apparent
disagreement, in which all action is &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; moral &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;
instrumental. I argued that this was part of a long argument in western
thought that took the division for granted and in which the problematic
was what the proper balance between the two spheres of life should be,
and that neither position can adequately comprehend forms of moral life
in which effective instrumentality is considered to have intrinsic
ethical&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacIntyre’s book historicizes this very distinction, attributing its
emergence to the attempt of Enlightenment thinkers to justify morality,
and looks at historical forms of virtue in which the good and the
effective were unified. MacIntyre’s target is not, of course,
‘neoliberalism-ism’, but a theory of morality he describes as emotivism.
He argues that emotivism dominates moral thought in the contemporary&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotivism, according to Macintyre, is premised on the division of the
social world&amp;nbsp;into,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…a realm of the organizational in which ends are taken to be given
and are not available for rational scrutiny and a realm of the personal
in which judgment and debate about values are central factors, but in
which no rational social resolution of issues is&amp;nbsp;available…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…debates are often staged in terms of a supposed opposition between
individualism and collectivism, each appearing in a variety of doctrinal
forms. On the one side there appear the self-defined protagonists of
individual liberty, on the other the self-defined protagonists of
planning and regulation, of the goods which are available through
bureaucratic organization. But in fact what is crucial is that on which
the contending parties agree, namely that there are only two alternative
modes of social life open to us, one in which the free and arbitrary
choices of individuals are sovereign and one in which the bureaucracy is
sovereign, precisely so it may limit the free and arbitrary choices if
individuals (p.&amp;nbsp;34f).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychologists such as Judith Smetana have argued that the distinction
between moral rule and social convention is innate and universal. That
may be so, but knowing that there is a difference is not the same as
knowing where the line can be drawn that divides the two. When we are in
familiar settings, the differences between tradition, habit, and
pragmatic efficiency on the one hand, and ethical considerations about
value and duty are frequently elided: there are a limited number of
given, concrete ways of living life, and most of our choices will be
made from among them. Even innovations justified on moral grounds will
silently incorporate much that is&amp;nbsp;conventional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when people speak ethically across regional boundaries, they must
face the problem of finding ways to render the ethics of different
regions commensurate, either by translating local, thick ethical
practices of one or both sides into the thin common currency of some
universalist morality, or by claiming that, in so far as the essentials
are concerned, what appear to be quite different values or practices are
in fact compatible. In either case, there is a need to agree on a place
to draw the line dividing universal or shared essence from contingent
cultural convention, to decide whether it is the specific practices that
are valued, or only the underlying principle, only their effects, or
some combination of these. This makes these conversations an ideal site
for scholars interested in understanding moral reasoning and its
relation to&amp;nbsp;practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;evidence of discontent about any aspect, be it ever so narrow, of

without further justification, as a rejection of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the
phenomena that have been so&amp;nbsp;identified&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point was that just because lots of people in different countries
are critics of, say, structural adjustment programmes, we cannot leap to
the conclusion that they share the same conception of the state and
civil society and all agree on the proper balance of power and resources
between the two; their motivations and assumptions might be quite
different in each&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a formal problem of cross-cultural description or comparison:
the conversation at cross-purposes. We recognize something familiar in
other people’s statements, and rush to fill in the rest from our own
common-sense ideas, which may be quite different. My favourite example
of this is one that operates in both directions — a reciprocal
conversation at&amp;nbsp;cross-purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="self-cultivation-jesus-christ-and-christ-jesus"&gt;Self-Cultivation,
Jesus Christ, and Christ&amp;nbsp;Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian missionaries, mainly Americans, operate in China in spite
of a prohibition on missionary activity. Their message tends to be the
&lt;strong&gt;rules-based&lt;/strong&gt; version of modern Evangelism that has taken
so much of the world by storm over the past 30 years: don’t drink, don’t
smoke, don’t gamble, and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians I have met in villages in the north of China, or people
who were &lt;em&gt;interested in Christianity&lt;/em&gt; as they would invariably
put it, were, it seemed to me, used to thinking about religious practice
quite differently: as being aimed at a gradual process of
&lt;strong&gt;self-cultivation&lt;/strong&gt;. Like an impressive athletic feat —
such as running a marathon — this is something that is easy for anyone
to admire. But to participate — that takes a certain degree of
commitment, free time and self-confidence. Again and again, when I asked
people if they were Christian they would self-deprecatingly say that
they knew little about it, that they were busy, but planned to start
being a Christian in the future, perhaps when the harvest was in and
there was less farm work to be&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in China researching the revival of Buddhism in Mongolian
areas, and Buddhists — or people who were interested in Buddhism — would
often tell me similar things: Buddhism is a deep culture that is very
powerful, but not many people are capable of putting it into practice,
they were happy being relatively passive&amp;nbsp;admirers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the village Christians do practise, they see the purpose of
self-denial not as the fulfilment of an imperative duty, but rather as a
technology through which they will gain good fortune through hard work.
This means that it the practices taught by missionaries, sometimes long
ago, tend to drift into more extreme forms of asceticism. For instance,
in one village I was told that a religion of Christ Jesus had emerged to
challenge the established religion of Jesus Christ. The followers of
Christ Jesus interpreted the injunction to pray often as an esoteric
teaching involving sitting absolutely still for hours with a wet towel
on one’s head— a dangerous as well as an uncomfortable proposition in
windy, icy Inner&amp;nbsp;Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="guilty-buddhists"&gt;Guilty&amp;nbsp;Buddhists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reciprocal part of this conversation at cross-purposes is the
adoption of Buddhism in many non-Asian contexts in which religion,
especially monotheisms, tends to be thought of as a revelation of moral
duty — that is, as part of a system of &lt;strong&gt;rule-based
morality&lt;/strong&gt; — rather than a set of technologies for
self-development. The corollary of duty is guilt. If what I have read is
representative, Western Buddhist leaders seem to be occupied quite a lot
of the time with advising their followers not to feel guilty if they
miss out on a meditation session (just google &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=don't+feel+guilty+for+not+meditating"&gt;‘don’t
feel guilty for not meditating’&lt;/a&gt; to see what I mean), or if they
cannot resist eating&amp;nbsp;meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conversation at cross-purposes is facilitated by near-enough
‘religion’ concepts — false friends that make communication easy, even
intuitive. The confusion that arises is evident in the accusations of
hypocrisy, or justifications of apparent hypocrisy, that arose in early
anthropological studies of&amp;nbsp;Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that a Buddhist who does not follow Buddhist precepts is
hypocritical, among my Inner Mongolian Buddhist friends at least, would
be as inappropriate as accusing a Manchester United fan of being
hypocritical for failing to play in the Premier League. On the other
side, to my Chinese and Mongolian informants, foreign religionists —
mainly those missionaries — often seem arrogant because they imagine
that they themselves are capable right now, without any preparation, let
alone indefinite deferment, of participating in all the practices that
are commanded of them by their God. (I’m not making a point about
Chinese people getting Christianity wrong, or non-Asians getting
Buddhism wrong — I don’t have a horse in those races, I’m just
interested in the formal&amp;nbsp;problem.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-request"&gt;A&amp;nbsp;request&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time I have been toying with the idea of compiling a
compendium of cross-cultural conversations at cross-purposes, or
cross-cultural faux amis / &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend"&gt;false friends&lt;/a&gt;. It
would include those situations in which concepts on each side of the
conversation are different enough to produce disagreements or confusion,
but similar enough that it may be unclear where the disagreement
originates. Please let me know in the comments or by email if you know
of any good examples for my&amp;nbsp;collection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="anthropology"></category><category term="Buddhism"></category><category term="China"></category><category term="Christianity"></category><category term="conversations at cross-purposes"></category><category term="ethics"></category><category term="Inner Mongolia"></category><category term="missionaries"></category><category term="self-cultivation"></category></entry></feed>
