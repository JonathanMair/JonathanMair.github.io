on religion and economics under the auspices of the Religion and
Political Culture Network (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPCN&lt;/span&gt;) at the University of Manchester. This
has got me thinking about Buddhism, economics and Buddhist economics,
and has led me to reread Ernst Friedrich Schumacher’s classic essay
&lt;em&gt;Buddhist economics&lt;/em&gt;, first published in 1966, and available
online&amp;nbsp;here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="uri" href="http://www.centerforneweconomics.org/buddhist-economics"&gt;http://www.centerforneweconomics.org/buddhist-economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fascinating piece, and though Schumacher’s arguments have
become commonplace among critics of mainstream economics, it’s
interesting just how current most of what he has to say sounds. Much of
what he has to say about the irrationality of certain assuptions in
academic economics is still being said today, for example by students
who are demanding changes in the way the subject is taught in
universities, tackled in a recent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt; radio documentary: &lt;a class="uri" href="http://bbc.in/1pBBGW9"&gt;http://bbc.in/1pBBGW9&lt;/a&gt;, and
in another broadcast last year: &lt;a class="uri" href="http://bbc.in/1y94uHF"&gt;http://bbc.in/1y94uHF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one of his claims about economics is arguably anachronistic: the
claim that economics considers only price in the use of different
natural resources, not whether they are renewable or not. I think that,
at least at the level of the economics of nations, the idea of
sustainability has gained significant traction since he was writing,
though he probably wouldn’t approve of the idea that the impact of
production on the environment can be ‘priced&amp;nbsp;in’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a summary of Schumacher’s main&amp;nbsp;points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="economics-is-not-value-free"&gt;1. Economics is not&amp;nbsp;value-free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He begins by regretting that leaders of Buddhist countries such as
Burma simultaneously say they want to retain and develop their Buddhist
traditions and ways of life, but seek advice from what he calls ‘modern’
and ‘materialist’&amp;nbsp;economists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might make sense if Buddhism and economics goverened two
completely distinct spheres of life. However, he argues that Buddhism,
which teaches Right Livelihood as part of the Eightfold Noble Path, must
have its own ideas about economics. On the other hand, he claims,
economics is not value-neutral, but is based on unacknowledged
metaphysical presuppositions that might be–and in fact are–in conflict
with the aims and premises of Buddhist&amp;nbsp;teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-meaning-of-labour"&gt;2. The meaning of&amp;nbsp;labour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schumacher discusses attitudes to work as an example of the (mostly
unspoken) assumptions that distinguish modern economics from Buddhist&amp;nbsp;economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the ‘modern’ economics, labour is an evil. For the worker, its
something that destroys leisure and for which compensation in the form
of wages is required. For the employer, it is a cost of production. The
more production (in the case of the employer) or income (in the case of
the worker) can be had for the less work the better. So one central aim
of modern economics is to reduce the quantitity of work required for a
given amount of production through mechanisation and the division of&amp;nbsp;labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Buddhist economics, in contrast, work is not a necessary evil,
but something that leads to a number of good outcomes apart from the
product itself, including the opportunity for the development of
character, and the opportunity to cooperate with others and in the
process overcome ‘ego-centredness’. Labour-saving innovations are not
necessarily bad, but their value depends on the extent to which they
free people from the heavy work to focus on more creating tasks, or to
the contrary, make work meaningless and&amp;nbsp;repetitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-middle-way-and-consumption"&gt;3. The Middle Way and&amp;nbsp;consumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern economics, Schumacher writes, assumes that wellbeing can be
measured by consumption, and therefore that greater annual rates of
consumption correspond to increased wellbeing. A Buddhist&amp;nbsp;economist,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘… would consider this approach excessively irrational: since
consumption is merely a means to human well-being, the aim should be to
obtain the maximum of well-being with the minimum of&amp;nbsp;consumption.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is reminiscent of Southwold’s (1983: 188) opposition between
Buddhist ‘sapientalism’, ‘a rational strategy for ameliorating
experience by altering the mind rather than the environing world’, and&amp;nbsp;instrumentalism.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach could easily be misunderstood. One might assume that
the opposite of materialism is anti-materialism, or the pursuit of
poverty. But Schumacher points out that Buddhism is not about the
rejection of wealth, but the rejection of excessive attachment to
wealth. The Buddha tried and rejected ascetic austerities and then
promoted instead the moderation of the Middle&amp;nbsp;Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="localism-simplicity-and-non-violence"&gt;4. Localism, simplicity
and&amp;nbsp;non-violence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schumacher argues that treating consumption as a means not an end in
itself means living simply (in order to leave oneself time to do what is
really important) and in accordance with non-violence (presumably
because consuming in a way that leads to violence would undermine the
proper goal of all consumption:&amp;nbsp;liberation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using less in the way of resources also minimises the causes of
violence as it reduces the competition for resources. Schumacher also
claims–perhaps the this is the most debatable claim in the essay–that
trading across large distances brings people into potentially hostile
contact so that Buddhist economics would advocate local self-sufficience
and minimal dependence on international&amp;nbsp;trade:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘dependence on imports from afar and the consequent need to produce
for export to unknown and distant peoples is highly uneconomic and
justifiable only in exceptional cases and on a small&amp;nbsp;scale.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="non-renewable-resources"&gt;5. Non-renewable&amp;nbsp;resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Schumacher argues that Buddhist economics and modern
economics take a different view on non-renewable resources. For modern
economics, all resources are reduced to a money price, and whatever
resource is the cheapest price for each unit of output is preferable.
For Buddhist economics, in contrast, using non-renewables is living
parasitically off&amp;nbsp;capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said above, this final point of criticism does sound rather
anachronistic&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;

version available through this website soon for those who don’t have
access to the journal through an academic&amp;nbsp;library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is titled ‘Cultures of ignorance’. In a nutshell, the
argument is that academic students of religion have settled on a way of
accounting for religious language and thought that distinguishes
ordinary, everyday belief from religious belief. The former is
understood to be literal and practical. The latter, by contrast, is
taken to be indirect, metaphorical, symbolic, affective, moral and so
on, and by implication &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be about propositional belief.
Drawing on my own field research in northern China’s Inner Mongolia, I
argue that there are ways of relating to a body of true knowledge that
fit neither of these models. I argue that in order to understand what is
going on in this situation and many others we need to develop an
ethnographic sensibility to locally specific ‘cultures of belief’. To
get this project off to a start, I suggest some initial building blocks
for a general anthropology of belief, based on religious thought in
ancient Greece, mediaeval Judaism, and contemporary &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Evangelism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the&amp;nbsp;abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In popular thought about the meaning of religion, as well as
established debates in anthropology, religious belief is interpreted as
either a commitment to a clear set of propositions, or as a non-literal,
symbolic, ethical or social commitment. Anthropologists have tended to
support the latter of these positions, so much so that this can now be
seen as the ‘anthropological’ position; it is also characteristic of the
view of scholars in related disciplines, such as religious studies. This
article argues for a third possibility: that religious (and other)
believers are often engaged in complex, reflexive practices that
stipulate specific cognitive and non-cognitive relationships to
propositional content. This is demonstrated with reference to
contemporary Buddhism in Inner Mongolia, China. The author argues that
the existence of such cultures of belief demonstrates there is a need
for a systematic anthropological theory of belief and suggests some
sources that may contribute to its&amp;nbsp;formulation.&lt;/p&gt;

phenomena that have been so&amp;nbsp;identified&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point was that just because lots of people in different countries
are critics of, say, structural adjustment programmes, we cannot leap to
the conclusion that they share the same conception of the state and
civil society and all agree on the proper balance of power and resources
between the two; their motivations and assumptions might be quite
different in each&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a formal problem of cross-cultural description or comparison:
the conversation at cross-purposes. We recognize something familiar in
other people’s statements, and rush to fill in the rest from our own
common-sense ideas, which may be quite different. My favourite example
of this is one that operates in both directions — a reciprocal
conversation at&amp;nbsp;cross-purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="self-cultivation-jesus-christ-and-christ-jesus"&gt;Self-Cultivation,
Jesus Christ, and Christ&amp;nbsp;Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian missionaries, mainly Americans, operate in China in spite
of a prohibition on missionary activity. Their message tends to be the
&lt;strong&gt;rules-based&lt;/strong&gt; version of modern Evangelism that has taken
so much of the world by storm over the past 30 years: don’t drink, don’t
smoke, don’t gamble, and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians I have met in villages in the north of China, or people
who were &lt;em&gt;interested in Christianity&lt;/em&gt; as they would invariably
put it, were, it seemed to me, used to thinking about religious practice
quite differently: as being aimed at a gradual process of
&lt;strong&gt;self-cultivation&lt;/strong&gt;. Like an impressive athletic feat —
such as running a marathon — this is something that is easy for anyone
to admire. But to participate — that takes a certain degree of
commitment, free time and self-confidence. Again and again, when I asked
people if they were Christian they would self-deprecatingly say that
they knew little about it, that they were busy, but planned to start
being a Christian in the future, perhaps when the harvest was in and
there was less farm work to be&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in China researching the revival of Buddhism in Mongolian
areas, and Buddhists — or people who were interested in Buddhism — would
often tell me similar things: Buddhism is a deep culture that is very
powerful, but not many people are capable of putting it into practice,
they were happy being relatively passive&amp;nbsp;admirers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the village Christians do practise, they see the purpose of
self-denial not as the fulfilment of an imperative duty, but rather as a
technology through which they will gain good fortune through hard work.
This means that it the practices taught by missionaries, sometimes long
ago, tend to drift into more extreme forms of asceticism. For instance,
in one village I was told that a religion of Christ Jesus had emerged to
challenge the established religion of Jesus Christ. The followers of
Christ Jesus interpreted the injunction to pray often as an esoteric
teaching involving sitting absolutely still for hours with a wet towel
on one’s head— a dangerous as well as an uncomfortable proposition in
windy, icy Inner&amp;nbsp;Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="guilty-buddhists"&gt;Guilty&amp;nbsp;Buddhists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reciprocal part of this conversation at cross-purposes is the
adoption of Buddhism in many non-Asian contexts in which religion,
especially monotheisms, tends to be thought of as a revelation of moral
duty — that is, as part of a system of &lt;strong&gt;rule-based
morality&lt;/strong&gt; — rather than a set of technologies for
self-development. The corollary of duty is guilt. If what I have read is
representative, Western Buddhist leaders seem to be occupied quite a lot
of the time with advising their followers not to feel guilty if they
miss out on a meditation session (just google &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=don't+feel+guilty+for+not+meditating"&gt;‘don’t
feel guilty for not meditating’&lt;/a&gt; to see what I mean), or if they
cannot resist eating&amp;nbsp;meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conversation at cross-purposes is facilitated by near-enough
‘religion’ concepts — false friends that make communication easy, even
intuitive. The confusion that arises is evident in the accusations of
hypocrisy, or justifications of apparent hypocrisy, that arose in early
anthropological studies of&amp;nbsp;Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that a Buddhist who does not follow Buddhist precepts is
hypocritical, among my Inner Mongolian Buddhist friends at least, would
be as inappropriate as accusing a Manchester United fan of being
hypocritical for failing to play in the Premier League. On the other
side, to my Chinese and Mongolian informants, foreign religionists —
mainly those missionaries — often seem arrogant because they imagine
that they themselves are capable right now, without any preparation, let
alone indefinite deferment, of participating in all the practices that
are commanded of them by their God. (I’m not making a point about
Chinese people getting Christianity wrong, or non-Asians getting
Buddhism wrong — I don’t have a horse in those races, I’m just
interested in the formal&amp;nbsp;problem.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-request"&gt;A&amp;nbsp;request&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time I have been toying with the idea of compiling a
compendium of cross-cultural conversations at cross-purposes, or
cross-cultural faux amis / &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend"&gt;false friends&lt;/a&gt;. It
would include those situations in which concepts on each side of the
conversation are different enough to produce disagreements or confusion,
but similar enough that it may be unclear where the disagreement
originates. Please let me know in the comments or by email if you know
of any good examples for my&amp;nbsp;collection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="anthropology"></category><category term="Buddhism"></category><category term="China"></category><category term="Christianity"></category><category term="conversations at cross-purposes"></category><category term="ethics"></category><category term="Inner Mongolia"></category><category term="missionaries"></category><category term="self-cultivation"></category></entry></feed>
