post&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to Needham’s review of Veyne’s book. The review is short, and
much is taken up with flattering comments on Veyne’s style, but overall
the conclusion is negative—he characterises the argument as ‘erratic and
inconsistent’. On my reading, Needham makes three substantive points,
which I shall deal with one by one here in order of&amp;nbsp;importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only criticism that really has bite is that Veyne is vague about
what the key terms in his analysis—belief and truth—mean to him. Partly
on the basis of Veyne’s previous work, Needham reads &lt;em&gt;Did the
Greeks…?&lt;/em&gt; as an exercise in epistemological relativism, and makes a
version of the usual objection to the paradoxes of relativism: if truth
is always to be defined in local terms, in relation to historically
specific programmes of truth, as Veyne would have it, then what exactly
does Veyne mean when he says, absolutely, and not qualified by any
context, that truth is&amp;nbsp;plural?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needham&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, Veyne actually concentrates not on belief but on
truth, but only to place himself in a further difficulty. He concedes
that ‘truth’ too means so many things, yet he passes over the variety of
theories of truth and, in the end, commits himself consistently to none.
The nearest he gets to a steady acceptance is to say that truths and
interests, which are both limited and arbitrary, are ‘two different
terms for the same&amp;nbsp;thing’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needham is right to call Veyne out for not clarifying his terms, and
attributing this weakness to strong epistemological relativism is not an
unreasonable interpretation. However, I believe another reading is&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veyne details the variety of ‘regimes of belief’ in terms of
different truth conditions and specific practices, such as the use of
footnotes in academic writing, with which they are associated. These
things are the specific form that believing has, historically taken. But
it is still possible to speak of believing in the abstract, as the
category to which all these concrete modes of belief belong. What is it
that makes the ordinary ancient Greek’s vague and lethargic belief in
gods and heroes an instance of the same class of phenomenon as the
mediaeval lawyer’s insistence on footnotes, and the modern newspaper
reader’s suspicion of bias? They are all specifications of the practical
and social relationship between thinker and what the thinker accepts as
truth. To put it more pithily, belief is about a relationship to a body
of&amp;nbsp;truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit, it’s not clear from Veyne’s text that this is what
&lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; means by belief and truth, but it’s a reading that makes
sense of his concrete claims, and saves his general conclusions from
Needham’s anti-relativist criticism. Needham is right that Veyne is
unclear on this score, and clarifying the meaning of the general
category of belief, and of the general category of truth on which it
depends will be an important task for any ethnographic approach to&amp;nbsp;belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="2" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He complains that Veyne, in seeking to understand belief, did not
take into account the attempts of philosophers such as Wittgenstein,
Hume, Kant, and so on to do the same&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These writers were engaged in what Veyne describes as an exercise of
‘the constitutive imagination’. Like the ancient and modern historians
whom Veyne describes, they were engaged in shaping programmes of truth,
legitimising some ‘regimes of belief’ and delegitimising others. They
were not in the business of describing the plural programmes of truth of
others, and they would only have had a place in the book alongside the
mediaeval jurists and modern journalists that Veyne—as case studies of
the kind of second-order belief theory and practice that Veyne is
interested in&amp;nbsp;describing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Veyne is writing at a higher level of generalisation
or abstraction than Kant et al., and for a different purpose. The
philosophers’ question would not have been ‘Did the Greeks believe in
their myths’, but the logically posterior question, ‘Were the Greeks
right to (dis)believe in their myths?’, which is only meaningful once it
is established whether or not (or to what extent, in what senses) they
did, in fact,&amp;nbsp;believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="3" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, Needham chides Veyne for not taking account of ‘sceptical
anthropology’. He argues that ethnographers have succeeded in explaining
the kinds god-language that Veyne’s question raises, but without
resorting to the notion of belief. He concludes that these&amp;nbsp;writers,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;confirm that it is not ‘pointless’, as Veyne proposes, to try to
determine the true thought of other peoples, but that we shall not do so
if we attribute our thoughts to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No page references are given in the review, but thanks to Google, it
is possible to trace the passage in Veyne’s book to which Needham
refers. Needham suggests that Veyne says it’s pointless ‘…to determine
the true thought of other peoples thought’. The ‘pointless’ here is
taken out of context and is quite misleading. In fact, Veyne was not
saying it was hopeless to try to understand ‘other people’s’ thought,
but that when faced with contradictory forms of thought, one must
recognise the plurality rather than trying to explain it away. The full
passage reads as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struggling to determine ‘the’ true thought of these people is
pointless, and it is equally unproductive to attempt to resolve these
contradictory thoughts by attributing one to popular religion and the
other to the beliefs of the privileged social classes. (Veyne&amp;nbsp;1988:89)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sceptical approach that Needham recommends begins by setting
aside the question of belief. It may have found other explanations for
religious language, and they may be illuminating, but this approach
cannot even recognise the plurality of modes of belief that Veyne draws
our attention to and makes it his business to describe and&amp;nbsp;understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, then, Needham’s critical review does not persuade me that
Veyne’s way of understanding belief is not a really critical piece in
understanding human thought, though Needham is right to say that Veyne
is vague about his key terms. They’re still arguing in my head and Veyne
is still&amp;nbsp;winning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen a dramatic growth in the study of ethics among
social anthropologists. Much of this growth has been due to the
assimilation into anthropological thinking of virtue ethics building on
two streams of theoretical work: that of Foucault, and that of virtue
ethicists working in the Anglo-Saxon philosophical tradition. Proponents
of the virtue-ethics approach in anthropology argue that a focus on
self-cultivation as a process allows for sufficient attention to be paid
to self-conscious reflection. Reflection and the freedom it entails,
they argue, are essential aspects of ethical life that traditional
social scientific approaches to ethics – Durkheimian approaches – simply&amp;nbsp;ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There appears to remain an area of ethical experience, however, that
neither approach can easily accommodate. Since virtue ethics sees
ethical judgment as the result of cultivation within a self-conscious
ethical tradition, it can no more account for ethical judgment outside
of or between traditions than the Durkheimian approach can. Yet history
is full of situations in which multiple, self-conscious ethical
traditions meet, and in which people try to judge each other, persuade
each other, or draw lessons from each other across the borders that
separate those traditions. These situations are what we call ‘speaking
ethically across borders’, and this is the phenomenon that the
conference will aim to&amp;nbsp;explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these situations, are people limited to using values with which
they are already familiar to interpret and judge other values? Or can
they genuinely learn from alternative ethical systems? If so, on what
conditions does this process depend? Is the capacity for or disposition
towards a cosmopolitan attitude to ethics itself a culturally specific
norm or a virtue to be perfected, or is it a necessary aspect of ethical
thought? Ethnographically speaking, how have people in fact used the
intellectual resources provided by one ethical tradition to judge
others? How have they sought to borrow from other traditions, or to
persuade followers of other traditions to adopt novel values and
practices? What meta-ethics have specific traditions proposed to govern
the relationship of members of the tradition to the mores of other&amp;nbsp;traditions?&lt;/p&gt;

version available through this website soon for those who don’t have
access to the journal through an academic&amp;nbsp;library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is titled ‘Cultures of ignorance’. In a nutshell, the
argument is that academic students of religion have settled on a way of
accounting for religious language and thought that distinguishes
ordinary, everyday belief from religious belief. The former is
understood to be literal and practical. The latter, by contrast, is
taken to be indirect, metaphorical, symbolic, affective, moral and so
on, and by implication &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be about propositional belief.
Drawing on my own field research in northern China’s Inner Mongolia, I
argue that there are ways of relating to a body of true knowledge that
fit neither of these models. I argue that in order to understand what is
going on in this situation and many others we need to develop an
ethnographic sensibility to locally specific ‘cultures of belief’. To
get this project off to a start, I suggest some initial building blocks
for a general anthropology of belief, based on religious thought in
ancient Greece, mediaeval Judaism, and contemporary &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Evangelism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the&amp;nbsp;abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In popular thought about the meaning of religion, as well as
established debates in anthropology, religious belief is interpreted as
either a commitment to a clear set of propositions, or as a non-literal,
symbolic, ethical or social commitment. Anthropologists have tended to
support the latter of these positions, so much so that this can now be
seen as the ‘anthropological’ position; it is also characteristic of the
view of scholars in related disciplines, such as religious studies. This
article argues for a third possibility: that religious (and other)
believers are often engaged in complex, reflexive practices that
stipulate specific cognitive and non-cognitive relationships to
propositional content. This is demonstrated with reference to
contemporary Buddhism in Inner Mongolia, China. The author argues that
the existence of such cultures of belief demonstrates there is a need
for a systematic anthropological theory of belief and suggests some
sources that may contribute to its&amp;nbsp;formulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychologists such as Judith Smetana have argued that the distinction
between moral rule and social convention is innate and universal. That
may be so, but knowing that there is a difference is not the same as
knowing where the line can be drawn that divides the two. When we are in
familiar settings, the differences between tradition, habit, and
pragmatic efficiency on the one hand, and ethical considerations about
value and duty are frequently elided: there are a limited number of
given, concrete ways of living life, and most of our choices will be
made from among them. Even innovations justified on moral grounds will
silently incorporate much that is&amp;nbsp;conventional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when people speak ethically across regional boundaries, they must
face the problem of finding ways to render the ethics of different
regions commensurate, either by translating local, thick ethical
practices of one or both sides into the thin common currency of some
universalist morality, or by claiming that, in so far as the essentials
are concerned, what appear to be quite different values or practices are
in fact compatible. In either case, there is a need to agree on a place
to draw the line dividing universal or shared essence from contingent
cultural convention, to decide whether it is the specific practices that
are valued, or only the underlying principle, only their effects, or
some combination of these. This makes these conversations an ideal site
for scholars interested in understanding moral reasoning and its
relation to&amp;nbsp;practice.&lt;/p&gt;

an annual debate on anthropological theory hosted by Manchester
University. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDAT&lt;/span&gt;, the Group for Debates in Anthropological Theory, was
started in the late 80s by Tim Ingold, and has been organized and
chaired more recently by Soumhya Venkatesan. This was the third &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDAT&lt;/span&gt; I
have attended and I think it’s a brilliant institution. People come from
all over the country, and the discussion is always highly engaged and
critical in the best&amp;nbsp;sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s motion was: &lt;em&gt;The concept of neoliberalism has become
an obstacle to the anthropological understanding of the twenty-first
century&lt;/em&gt;. James Laidlaw was proposing, I seconded, and Thomas
Hylland Eriksen and Keir Martin&amp;nbsp;opposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the concept of ‘neoliberalism’ has been a bugbear of mine
since a conference I attended in 2009. Every panel I attended had at
least one paper on neoliberalism, but each seemed to be talking about
quite different, even contradictory, things — the neoliberal tag seemed
to add nothing. Or worse, it seemed portentously to invoke a whole
global theory as a background explanation without doing the work of
showing how ‘global forces’ are actually linked to or expressed in the
sort of ‘local’ settings the speakers were talking about. It has become
a kind of disciplinary common sense reinforced by a smug sense of shared
moral indignation and that is reason enough to question its&amp;nbsp;usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the speeches will be available on the University of Manchester
website soon, and I understand a recording of the debate will be made
available as a podcast. Eventually, the whole thing, with a
transcription of the questions following the speeches, will be published
in &lt;a href="http://coa.sagepub.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critique of
Anthropology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, I’ll be happy to send anyone
who’s interested a copy of my speech — here’s a&amp;nbsp;snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discourse of academic critics of neoliberalism is nothing but the
discourse of the academic proponents of neoliberalism—but with the signs&amp;nbsp;reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither side invented the categories it works with. This disagreement
is simply the latest battle in a long, long war in western thought about
the proper balance of the moral and the instrumental spheres of life.
One side in this argument has always argued that the sphere of economic
rationality should be carefully constrained in order to preserve moral
life from its taint. The other side has always argued that more amoral
selfishness in the short term will produce the optimum outcome for all
in the end and is therefore, only apparently paradoxically, the more
moral course of action. What both sides take for granted is the
fundamental division of the moral from the instrumental. (If the concept
of ‘ontology’ were not just as compromised as ‘neoliberalism’, one might
want to deploy it here.) The use of the concept of neoliberalism in
anthropological writing has been little more than an excuse to rehearse
this old and essentially parochial argument, in a way that appears to
mobilize ethnographic evidence but in fact precludes the possibility of
learning anything&amp;nbsp;new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lost, horribly. I got a good laugh with that line about ‘ontology’
though…talk about professional&amp;nbsp;in-jokes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call for Papers at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IUAES&lt;/span&gt; Congress, at the University of
Manchester, 5th-10th August&amp;nbsp;2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panel Title : Cultures of&amp;nbsp;Ignorance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deadline for abstracts : 13th July&amp;nbsp;2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is nothing new for anthropologists to be curious about things that
for us, as outsiders, are hidden from view. In Melanesia and West
Africa, where concealed ritual practices are central in customary
politics, “secrecy” has long been an ethnographic preoccupation. With
elaborate systems of esoteric knowledge, these regions have proved
particularly fertile ground for western scholars with a poetic
preference for the other-worldly. However anthropologists have rarely
paid attention to an indispensible condition of secret knowledge: the
experience of&amp;nbsp;ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with culturally produced forms of not-knowing, the
assumption has often been that we should set out to pierce that
ignorance. According to this logic, it is only “by peering behind the
facade that we see things as an insider rather than as outsiders and
thereby discover the truth” (Gable 1997: 215). But does uncovering
‘hidden truth’ risk distorting the way in which our interlocutors
experience (not)knowing in their daily&amp;nbsp;lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This panel invites contributions which explore the question of
ignorance from exactly the opposite direction; beginning with the
recognition that ethnographers are often far from being the only people
on the “wrong” side of this knowlege façade. The discussion will
contribute to a small but growing body of work (reviews in Mair, Kelly
&amp;amp;amp; High 2012; McGoey 2012) that aims to take ignorance seriously
– not simply as the absence of knowledge, but as an ethnographic object
in its own&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;

Palgrave&amp;nbsp;Macmillan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new volume on the anthropology of ignorance, which I edited with
Casey High and Ann Kelly, came out last week with Palgrave. I’m really
pleased with the finished product, and that’s all down to the
contributors who have produced some excellent chapters…and stuck to all
the deadlines—many thanks to all of&amp;nbsp;you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general argument that the book advances is simply that ignorance
is something that many people value, something whose particular
characteristics in any context may have far reaching consequences, and
that it is therefore something that deserves our&amp;nbsp;attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropologists have been reluctant to acknowledge this in the past.
One reason for this has been because one of anthropology’s most
important roles has been to show that members of the societies in which
anthropologists typically conduct research are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; benighted
and ignorant, but actually hold quite extensive and sophisticated
knowledge about practical or technical things, such as botany, as well
as culturally important things, such as genealogies and&amp;nbsp;myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we propose is a new approach—an ethnographic approach,
exemplified by the chapters in the book. Actually, we suggest this is a
new approach that is already becoming&amp;nbsp;widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quotation from the first&amp;nbsp;chapter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Making ignorance an ethnographic object is an important move because
of the questions it leads us to ask. It means asking not: There are the
things we don’t know; why is it we don’t know them? but rather, Given
that the set of things we do not know is necessarily without limit, how
and why do we become aware of particular areas of ignorance? How are
various forms of the condition of being ignorant (the equivalent of
expertise) recognized? How are forms of ignorance transmitted or taught?
How are they regulated? What kinds of roles or relationships does
ignorance depend on or produce? Do people intentionally act to develop
their awareness of ignorance? Why do people engage in the production of
forms of ignorance? What is the rationale for practices that produce
ignorance? What effects does a given form of ignorance give rise to and
how are these related to its production? How does a particular form of
ignorance affect the relationships to forms of knowledge of those in
whom it is&amp;nbsp;produced?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
