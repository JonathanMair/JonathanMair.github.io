&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have come to despise the term “neoliberal,” to the extent that I’d
really like to see it stricken from academic vocabularies everywhere.
It’s less that I have a problem with the actual critique that the term
is meant to levy than with the utterly sloppy and nearly always casually
derisive way in which the term is of late being thrown about. 1
“Neoliberal” is hardly ever used these days to point to instances of the
elevation of market values above all others — it’s used to tar anything
that has anything to do with any market realities whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Obsolescence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://kfitz.info/more-on-that-word/"&gt;later post&lt;/a&gt;,
she says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like “bourgeois” or “reactionary” or any number of other such terms,
I have too often of late heard “neoliberal” deployed as an insult by
people on the left against &lt;em&gt;other people on the left&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the
classic circular firing squad of ideological purity, and it makes me
nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
