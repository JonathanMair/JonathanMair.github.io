an annual debate on anthropological theory hosted by Manchester
University. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDAT&lt;/span&gt;, the Group for Debates in Anthropological Theory, was
started in the late 80s by Tim Ingold, and has been organized and
chaired more recently by Soumhya Venkatesan. This was the third &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDAT&lt;/span&gt; I
have attended and I think it’s a brilliant institution. People come from
all over the country, and the discussion is always highly engaged and
critical in the best&amp;nbsp;sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s motion was: &lt;em&gt;The concept of neoliberalism has become
an obstacle to the anthropological understanding of the twenty-first
century&lt;/em&gt;. James Laidlaw was proposing, I seconded, and Thomas
Hylland Eriksen and Keir Martin&amp;nbsp;opposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the concept of ‘neoliberalism’ has been a bugbear of mine
since a conference I attended in 2009. Every panel I attended had at
least one paper on neoliberalism, but each seemed to be talking about
quite different, even contradictory, things — the neoliberal tag seemed
to add nothing. Or worse, it seemed portentously to invoke a whole
global theory as a background explanation without doing the work of
showing how ‘global forces’ are actually linked to or expressed in the
sort of ‘local’ settings the speakers were talking about. It has become
a kind of disciplinary common sense reinforced by a smug sense of shared
moral indignation and that is reason enough to question its&amp;nbsp;usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the speeches will be available on the University of Manchester
website soon, and I understand a recording of the debate will be made
available as a podcast. Eventually, the whole thing, with a
transcription of the questions following the speeches, will be published
in &lt;a href="http://coa.sagepub.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critique of
Anthropology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, I’ll be happy to send anyone
who’s interested a copy of my speech — here’s a&amp;nbsp;snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discourse of academic critics of neoliberalism is nothing but the
discourse of the academic proponents of neoliberalism—but with the signs&amp;nbsp;reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither side invented the categories it works with. This disagreement
is simply the latest battle in a long, long war in western thought about
the proper balance of the moral and the instrumental spheres of life.
One side in this argument has always argued that the sphere of economic
rationality should be carefully constrained in order to preserve moral
life from its taint. The other side has always argued that more amoral
selfishness in the short term will produce the optimum outcome for all
in the end and is therefore, only apparently paradoxically, the more
moral course of action. What both sides take for granted is the
fundamental division of the moral from the instrumental. (If the concept
of ‘ontology’ were not just as compromised as ‘neoliberalism’, one might
want to deploy it here.) The use of the concept of neoliberalism in
anthropological writing has been little more than an excuse to rehearse
this old and essentially parochial argument, in a way that appears to
mobilize ethnographic evidence but in fact precludes the possibility of
learning anything&amp;nbsp;new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lost, horribly. I got a good laugh with that line about ‘ontology’
though…talk about professional&amp;nbsp;in-jokes!&lt;/p&gt;
