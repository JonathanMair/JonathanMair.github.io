an annual debate on anthropological theory hosted by Manchester
University. GDAT, the Group for Debates in Anthropological Theory, was
started in the late 80s by Tim Ingold, and has been organized and
chaired more recently by Soumhya Venkatesan. This was the third GDAT I
have attended and I think it’s a brilliant institution. People come from
all over the country, and the discussion is always highly engaged and
critical in the best sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s motion was: &lt;em&gt;The concept of neoliberalism has become
an obstacle to the anthropological understanding of the twenty-first
century&lt;/em&gt;. James Laidlaw was proposing, I seconded, and Thomas
Hylland Eriksen and Keir Martin opposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the concept of ‘neoliberalism’ has been a bugbear of mine
since a conference I attended in 2009. Every panel I attended had at
least one paper on neoliberalism, but each seemed to be talking about
quite different, even contradictory, things — the neoliberal tag seemed
to add nothing. Or worse, it seemed portentously to invoke a whole
global theory as a background explanation without doing the work of
showing how ‘global forces’ are actually linked to or expressed in the
sort of ‘local’ settings the speakers were talking about. It has become
a kind of disciplinary common sense reinforced by a smug sense of shared
moral indignation and that is reason enough to question its
usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the speeches will be available on the University of Manchester
website soon, and I understand a recording of the debate will be made
available as a podcast. Eventually, the whole thing, with a
transcription of the questions following the speeches, will be published
in &lt;a href="http://coa.sagepub.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critique of
Anthropology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, I’ll be happy to send anyone
who’s interested a copy of my speech — here’s a snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discourse of academic critics of neoliberalism is nothing but the
discourse of the academic proponents of neoliberalism—but with the signs
reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither side invented the categories it works with. This disagreement
is simply the latest battle in a long, long war in western thought about
the proper balance of the moral and the instrumental spheres of life.
One side in this argument has always argued that the sphere of economic
rationality should be carefully constrained in order to preserve moral
life from its taint. The other side has always argued that more amoral
selfishness in the short term will produce the optimum outcome for all
in the end and is therefore, only apparently paradoxically, the more
moral course of action. What both sides take for granted is the
fundamental division of the moral from the instrumental. (If the concept
of ‘ontology’ were not just as compromised as ‘neoliberalism’, one might
want to deploy it here.) The use of the concept of neoliberalism in
anthropological writing has been little more than an excuse to rehearse
this old and essentially parochial argument, in a way that appears to
mobilize ethnographic evidence but in fact precludes the possibility of
learning anything new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lost, horribly. I got a good laugh with that line about ‘ontology’
though…talk about professional in-jokes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call for Papers at the IUAES Congress, at the University of
Manchester, 5th-10th August 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panel Title : Cultures of Ignorance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deadline for abstracts : 13th July 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is nothing new for anthropologists to be curious about things that
for us, as outsiders, are hidden from view. In Melanesia and West
Africa, where concealed ritual practices are central in customary
politics, “secrecy” has long been an ethnographic preoccupation. With
elaborate systems of esoteric knowledge, these regions have proved
particularly fertile ground for western scholars with a poetic
preference for the other-worldly. However anthropologists have rarely
paid attention to an indispensible condition of secret knowledge: the
experience of ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with culturally produced forms of not-knowing, the
assumption has often been that we should set out to pierce that
ignorance. According to this logic, it is only “by peering behind the
facade that we see things as an insider rather than as outsiders and
thereby discover the truth” (Gable 1997: 215). But does uncovering
‘hidden truth’ risk distorting the way in which our interlocutors
experience (not)knowing in their daily lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This panel invites contributions which explore the question of
ignorance from exactly the opposite direction; beginning with the
recognition that ethnographers are often far from being the only people
on the “wrong” side of this knowlege façade. The discussion will
contribute to a small but growing body of work (reviews in Mair, Kelly
&amp;amp;amp; High 2012; McGoey 2012) that aims to take ignorance seriously
– not simply as the absence of knowledge, but as an ethnographic object
in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convenors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Mair (Manchester University)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Diggins (University of Sussex)&lt;/p&gt;
