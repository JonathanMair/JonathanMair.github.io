&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countless commentators have announced the advent of the post-truth
era, but while everyone seems to be talking about it, there is little
agreement about what it really means. This article argues that
anthropology can make an important and distinctive contribution to
understanding post-truth by treating it ethnographically. Commonly
proposed explanations for post-truth include changes in political
culture, in the structure of information in the digital age and
universal cognitive weaknesses that limit people’s capacity for critical
thought. While all these are likely important factors, they do not
account for the role of culture in creating and sustaining post-truth.
In fact, it is likely that culture, especially in the form of
metacognition, or thought about thought, plays an important role by
providing knowledge practices, techniques for allocating attention, and
especially competing theories of truth. Ethnographic methods provide
anthropologists with a distinctive window on post-truth cultures of
metacognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
