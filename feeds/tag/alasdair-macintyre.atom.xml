Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (1981), and I’ve just come
across a passage that is related to my recent argument about the
problems of the use of the concept of neoliberalism in anthropology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my argument was that academic advocates of neoliberalism and
academic critics of it share a view of the world, for all their apparent
disagreement, in which all action is &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; moral &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;
instrumental. I argued that this was part of a long argument in western
thought that took the division for granted and in which the problematic
was what the proper balance between the two spheres of life should be,
and that neither position can adequately comprehend forms of moral life
in which effective instrumentality is considered to have intrinsic
ethical value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacIntyre’s book historicizes this very distinction, attributing its
emergence to the attempt of Enlightenment thinkers to justify morality,
and looks at historical forms of virtue in which the good and the
effective were unified. MacIntyre’s target is not, of course,
‘neoliberalism-ism’, but a theory of morality he describes as emotivism.
He argues that emotivism dominates moral thought in the contemporary
world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotivism, according to Macintyre, is premised on the division of the
social world into,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…a realm of the organizational in which ends are taken to be given
and are not available for rational scrutiny and a realm of the personal
in which judgment and debate about values are central factors, but in
which no rational social resolution of issues is available…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…debates are often staged in terms of a supposed opposition between
individualism and collectivism, each appearing in a variety of doctrinal
forms. On the one side there appear the self-defined protagonists of
individual liberty, on the other the self-defined protagonists of
planning and regulation, of the goods which are available through
bureaucratic organization. But in fact what is crucial is that on which
the contending parties agree, namely that there are only two alternative
modes of social life open to us, one in which the free and arbitrary
choices of individuals are sovereign and one in which the bureaucracy is
sovereign, precisely so it may limit the free and arbitrary choices if
individuals (p. 34f).&lt;/p&gt;
