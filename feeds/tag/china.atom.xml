&lt;p&gt;evidence of discontent about any aspect, be it ever so narrow, of
what have been identified as neoliberal transformations is taken,
without further justification, as a rejection of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the
phenomena that have been so identified&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point was that just because lots of people in different countries
are critics of, say, structural adjustment programmes, we cannot leap to
the conclusion that they share the same conception of the state and
civil society and all agree on the proper balance of power and resources
between the two; their motivations and assumptions might be quite
different in each case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a formal problem of cross-cultural description or comparison:
the conversation at cross-purposes. We recognize something familiar in
other people’s statements, and rush to fill in the rest from our own
common-sense ideas, which may be quite different. My favourite example
of this is one that operates in both directions — a reciprocal
conversation at cross-purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="self-cultivation-jesus-christ-and-christ-jesus"&gt;Self-Cultivation,
Jesus Christ, and Christ Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian missionaries, mainly Americans, operate in China in spite
of a prohibition on missionary activity. Their message tends to be the
&lt;strong&gt;rules-based&lt;/strong&gt; version of modern Evangelism that has taken
so much of the world by storm over the past 30 years: don’t drink, don’t
smoke, don’t gamble, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians I have met in villages in the north of China, or people
who were &lt;em&gt;interested in Christianity&lt;/em&gt; as they would invariably
put it, were, it seemed to me, used to thinking about religious practice
quite differently: as being aimed at a gradual process of
&lt;strong&gt;self-cultivation&lt;/strong&gt;. Like an impressive athletic feat —
such as running a marathon — this is something that is easy for anyone
to admire. But to participate — that takes a certain degree of
commitment, free time and self-confidence. Again and again, when I asked
people if they were Christian they would self-deprecatingly say that
they knew little about it, that they were busy, but planned to start
being a Christian in the future, perhaps when the harvest was in and
there was less farm work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in China researching the revival of Buddhism in Mongolian
areas, and Buddhists — or people who were interested in Buddhism — would
often tell me similar things: Buddhism is a deep culture that is very
powerful, but not many people are capable of putting it into practice,
they were happy being relatively passive admirers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the village Christians do practise, they see the purpose of
self-denial not as the fulfilment of an imperative duty, but rather as a
technology through which they will gain good fortune through hard work.
This means that it the practices taught by missionaries, sometimes long
ago, tend to drift into more extreme forms of asceticism. For instance,
in one village I was told that a religion of Christ Jesus had emerged to
challenge the established religion of Jesus Christ. The followers of
Christ Jesus interpreted the injunction to pray often as an esoteric
teaching involving sitting absolutely still for hours with a wet towel
on one’s head— a dangerous as well as an uncomfortable proposition in
windy, icy Inner Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="guilty-buddhists"&gt;Guilty Buddhists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reciprocal part of this conversation at cross-purposes is the
adoption of Buddhism in many non-Asian contexts in which religion,
especially monotheisms, tends to be thought of as a revelation of moral
duty — that is, as part of a system of &lt;strong&gt;rule-based
morality&lt;/strong&gt; — rather than a set of technologies for
self-development. The corollary of duty is guilt. If what I have read is
representative, Western Buddhist leaders seem to be occupied quite a lot
of the time with advising their followers not to feel guilty if they
miss out on a meditation session (just google &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=don't+feel+guilty+for+not+meditating"&gt;‘don’t
feel guilty for not meditating’&lt;/a&gt; to see what I mean), or if they
cannot resist eating meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conversation at cross-purposes is facilitated by near-enough
‘religion’ concepts — false friends that make communication easy, even
intuitive. The confusion that arises is evident in the accusations of
hypocrisy, or justifications of apparent hypocrisy, that arose in early
anthropological studies of Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that a Buddhist who does not follow Buddhist precepts is
hypocritical, among my Inner Mongolian Buddhist friends at least, would
be as inappropriate as accusing a Manchester United fan of being
hypocritical for failing to play in the Premier League. On the other
side, to my Chinese and Mongolian informants, foreign religionists —
mainly those missionaries — often seem arrogant because they imagine
that they themselves are capable right now, without any preparation, let
alone indefinite deferment, of participating in all the practices that
are commanded of them by their God. (I’m not making a point about
Chinese people getting Christianity wrong, or non-Asians getting
Buddhism wrong — I don’t have a horse in those races, I’m just
interested in the formal problem.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-request"&gt;A request&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time I have been toying with the idea of compiling a
compendium of cross-cultural conversations at cross-purposes, or
cross-cultural faux amis / &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend"&gt;false friends&lt;/a&gt;. It
would include those situations in which concepts on each side of the
conversation are different enough to produce disagreements or confusion,
but similar enough that it may be unclear where the disagreement
originates. Please let me know in the comments or by email if you know
of any good examples for my collection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="anthropology"></category><category term="Buddhism"></category><category term="China"></category><category term="Christianity"></category><category term="conversations at cross-purposes"></category><category term="ethics"></category><category term="Inner Mongolia"></category><category term="missionaries"></category><category term="self-cultivation"></category></entry><entry><title>Evolution and Religion Part III</title><link href="https://www.jonathanmair.com/evolution-and-religion-part-iii.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-11-18T20:09:45+01:00</published><updated>2024-05-02T02:27:48+02:00</updated><author><name>Jonathan Mair</name></author><id>tag:www.jonathanmair.com,2012-11-18:/evolution-and-religion-part-iii.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Michael,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the fundamental questions remains: Why are only “religious”
communities able to augment this in-group cooperation not, say,
political parties or sport clubs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly an interesting question, and one that is not
affected by the objections in my previous post, but I do have some
reservations on this count too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="comparing-like-with-like"&gt;1. Comparing like with like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can address the question, we need to make sure we’re
comparing like with like. From your &lt;a href="http://www.scilogs.com/nature-of-faith/its-about-fertility-stupid-the-evolutionary-adaptivity-of-religion/"&gt;original
post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found many religious traditions that were able to attain high
levels of fertility throughout the generations. But in sharp empirical
contrast, we didn’t find a single non-religious community, movement or
population that was able to retain at least replacement level (two
births per woman) for a century!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way you put this explicitly rules out any kind of organization
that is not involved in baby making (“two births per woman”). That’s
fair enough, as you’re interested in evolution, which ultimately depends
on differential reproductive advantage. But doing this also means that
you cannot legitimately take such organizations as sports clubs as
secular equivalents of religious groups in your comparisons. Of course
tennis clubs can’t achieve two births per woman — they don’t (as far as
I know) admit members by birth! This has no necessary or causal relation
to religiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 205px"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.medals.org.uk/mongolia/mongolia020.htm"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mongolian Medal: ‘Aldart Ekh’ – Renowned Mother, First Class" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.medals.org.uk/mongolia/images/mongolia028.jpg?resize=205%2C250" title="Mongolian Medal: 'Aldart Ekh' -- Renowned Mother, First Class"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;
Mongolian Medal: ‘Aldart Ekh’ — Renowned Mother, First Class
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a comparison in terms of replacement by birth — the
comparison that would allow us to reach the conclusion that religious
communities have an advantage over non-religious ones in terms of
reproduction — &lt;strong&gt;we’d have to find non-religious organizations
that *did* base membership at least in part on reproduction and
birth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to non-reproduction related groups such as sports clubs
and political parties, it is hard to think of many examples. Why that
should be the case is an interesting question in itself — I’ll consider
that below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some modernist nationalisms (especially those allied to
eugenic policies?), or ethnic groups without strong religious
affiliation (some national minorities in China?) would fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are good examples of the former — I’m thinking especially of
the Hero Mother campaigns in the Soviet Union and other Communist
countries, and these did achieve very high birth rates. Some people have
argued that Stalinism had religious characteristics — maybe so, but it
was certainly not interested in non-empirical agents
(i.e. ‘religiosity’, in your terms). When I first went to Ulanbaatar in
2002, many people still proudly declared themselves ‘materialist’ when I
asked them about religion! These national movements really did achieve
huge population growth. Admittedly, it was not sustained over much more
than two generations….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-historical-question"&gt;2. The historical question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…Which brings us to my second reservation: the historical depth, or
lack of it, of non-religious organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were going to make a generalization about the relative
reproductive success of religious and non-religious communities, one
that is to hold good across evolutionary time, we would need to have a
decent number of examples of both kinds of community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are good reasons to think it is impossible to find a sufficient
sample of non-religious, membership-by-reproduction communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason is the historical novelty of secularism. The idea of
having communities or institutions that exclude religiosity (on your
definition) simply does not have a long history. It is an idea that had
its origins in the Enlightenment or the development of the nation state
(see Talal Asad, Charles Taylor — refs below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more general account might give a role to the modern phenomenon of
‘purification’. Early anthropologists were fascinated by the fact that
the institutions they studied among ‘natives’ in colonial contexts
around the world could not be pigeonholed into one of the major
categories that we use to understand modern society, such as politics,
economics, kinship, religion and so on. For example, an annual meeting
between villages might involve arrangements for marriages (kinship),
exchanges of goods (economics), offerings to ancestors (religion), and
alliances (politics). Marcel Mauss called this a total institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, modern societies are characterized by an attempt to
purify institutions so that they only perform one kind of role…if your
economic institution also performs kinship functions, that’s called
nepotism! If your political institution performs commercial functions,
corruption! Bruno Latour has argued that this work of purification is
more rhetorical than actual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the evidence seems to suggest that secular communities in
general were either very rare or non-existent (on a broad or narrow
definition of secularism, respectively) until the modern
period.&lt;/strong&gt; This explanation accounts parsimoniously for your being
unable to find any long-lived communities defined by their exclusion of
religion throughout history — there simply weren’t any such communities
until relatively recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the lack of longstanding communities of this kind were instead
down to relative reproductive disadvantage, am I wrong in thinking that
we should see a long history of ephemeral secular birth-related
communities that die out quickly? Can you name any one such community
dating to before 1600? The examples you give of communities that did not
prosper are defined by their &lt;em&gt;religious&lt;/em&gt; characteristics — they
don’t appear to be secular in any sense (Shakers, ancient Pagans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it may be too soon to say whether secular birth-related
communities will prove to be successful. It may continue to be difficult
to say: the reason such communities are &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; likely to be rare
may be that the modern practice of purification that I outlined above
tends to militate against birth/kinship functions being mixed up with
other functions. Such a mixture would be a necessary condition of
recognizing a community as anything other than a kinship group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;3. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my reservations about comparisons before the modern period and
comparisons are justified, then what remains to be explained is the
apparent reproductive advantage of religiously defined groups over other
groups &lt;em&gt;in the modern period&lt;/em&gt; — accepting your example of
Switzerland as representative and unproblematic. The relation of this
phenomenon to religiosity, on your definition, was the subject of my
previous two posts.&lt;/p&gt;
