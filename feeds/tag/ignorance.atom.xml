&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countless commentators have announced the advent of the post-truth
era, but while everyone seems to be talking about it, there is little
agreement about what it really means. This article argues that
anthropology can make an important and distinctive contribution to
understanding post-truth by treating it ethnographically. Commonly
proposed explanations for post-truth include changes in political
culture, in the structure of information in the digital age and
universal cognitive weaknesses that limit people’s capacity for critical
thought. While all these are likely important factors, they do not
account for the role of culture in creating and sustaining post-truth.
In fact, it is likely that culture, especially in the form of
metacognition, or thought about thought, plays an important role by
providing knowledge practices, techniques for allocating attention, and
especially competing theories of truth. Ethnographic methods provide
anthropologists with a distinctive window on post-truth cultures of&amp;nbsp;metacognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

“The use of the borders and the limits of knowing, including the
intentional and the unintentional consideration or bracketing out of
what is not known, towards the achievement of goals (i.e., social,
cultural, political, professional, and economic)”&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call for Papers at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IUAES&lt;/span&gt; Congress, at the University of
Manchester, 5th-10th August&amp;nbsp;2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panel Title : Cultures of&amp;nbsp;Ignorance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deadline for abstracts : 13th July&amp;nbsp;2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is nothing new for anthropologists to be curious about things that
for us, as outsiders, are hidden from view. In Melanesia and West
Africa, where concealed ritual practices are central in customary
politics, “secrecy” has long been an ethnographic preoccupation. With
elaborate systems of esoteric knowledge, these regions have proved
particularly fertile ground for western scholars with a poetic
preference for the other-worldly. However anthropologists have rarely
paid attention to an indispensible condition of secret knowledge: the
experience of&amp;nbsp;ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with culturally produced forms of not-knowing, the
assumption has often been that we should set out to pierce that
ignorance. According to this logic, it is only “by peering behind the
facade that we see things as an insider rather than as outsiders and
thereby discover the truth” (Gable 1997: 215). But does uncovering
‘hidden truth’ risk distorting the way in which our interlocutors
experience (not)knowing in their daily&amp;nbsp;lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This panel invites contributions which explore the question of
ignorance from exactly the opposite direction; beginning with the
recognition that ethnographers are often far from being the only people
on the “wrong” side of this knowlege façade. The discussion will
contribute to a small but growing body of work (reviews in Mair, Kelly
&amp;amp;amp; High 2012; McGoey 2012) that aims to take ignorance seriously
– not simply as the absence of knowledge, but as an ethnographic object
in its own&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new volume on the anthropology of ignorance, which I edited with
Casey High and Ann Kelly, came out last week with Palgrave. I’m really
pleased with the finished product, and that’s all down to the
contributors who have produced some excellent chapters…and stuck to all
the deadlines—many thanks to all of&amp;nbsp;you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general argument that the book advances is simply that ignorance
is something that many people value, something whose particular
characteristics in any context may have far reaching consequences, and
that it is therefore something that deserves our&amp;nbsp;attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropologists have been reluctant to acknowledge this in the past.
One reason for this has been because one of anthropology’s most
important roles has been to show that members of the societies in which
anthropologists typically conduct research are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; benighted
and ignorant, but actually hold quite extensive and sophisticated
knowledge about practical or technical things, such as botany, as well
as culturally important things, such as genealogies and&amp;nbsp;myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we propose is a new approach—an ethnographic approach,
exemplified by the chapters in the book. Actually, we suggest this is a
new approach that is already becoming&amp;nbsp;widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quotation from the first&amp;nbsp;chapter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Making ignorance an ethnographic object is an important move because
of the questions it leads us to ask. It means asking not: There are the
things we don’t know; why is it we don’t know them? but rather, Given
that the set of things we do not know is necessarily without limit, how
and why do we become aware of particular areas of ignorance? How are
various forms of the condition of being ignorant (the equivalent of
expertise) recognized? How are forms of ignorance transmitted or taught?
How are they regulated? What kinds of roles or relationships does
ignorance depend on or produce? Do people intentionally act to develop
their awareness of ignorance? Why do people engage in the production of
forms of ignorance? What is the rationale for practices that produce
ignorance? What effects does a given form of ignorance give rise to and
how are these related to its production? How does a particular form of
ignorance affect the relationships to forms of knowledge of those in
whom it is&amp;nbsp;produced?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
