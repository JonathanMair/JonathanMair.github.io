&lt;p&gt;Call for Papers at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IUAES&lt;/span&gt; Congress, at the University of
Manchester, 5th-10th August&amp;nbsp;2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panel Title : Cultures of&amp;nbsp;Ignorance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deadline for abstracts : 13th July&amp;nbsp;2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is nothing new for anthropologists to be curious about things that
for us, as outsiders, are hidden from view. In Melanesia and West
Africa, where concealed ritual practices are central in customary
politics, “secrecy” has long been an ethnographic preoccupation. With
elaborate systems of esoteric knowledge, these regions have proved
particularly fertile ground for western scholars with a poetic
preference for the other-worldly. However anthropologists have rarely
paid attention to an indispensible condition of secret knowledge: the
experience of&amp;nbsp;ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with culturally produced forms of not-knowing, the
assumption has often been that we should set out to pierce that
ignorance. According to this logic, it is only “by peering behind the
facade that we see things as an insider rather than as outsiders and
thereby discover the truth” (Gable 1997: 215). But does uncovering
‘hidden truth’ risk distorting the way in which our interlocutors
experience (not)knowing in their daily&amp;nbsp;lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This panel invites contributions which explore the question of
ignorance from exactly the opposite direction; beginning with the
recognition that ethnographers are often far from being the only people
on the “wrong” side of this knowlege façade. The discussion will
contribute to a small but growing body of work (reviews in Mair, Kelly
&amp;amp;amp; High 2012; McGoey 2012) that aims to take ignorance seriously
– not simply as the absence of knowledge, but as an ethnographic object
in its own&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convenors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Mair (Manchester&amp;nbsp;University)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Diggins (University of&amp;nbsp;Sussex)&lt;/p&gt;
