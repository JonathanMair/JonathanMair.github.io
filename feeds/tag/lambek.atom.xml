&lt;p&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen a dramatic growth in the study of ethics among
social anthropologists. Much of this growth has been due to the
assimilation into anthropological thinking of virtue ethics building on
two streams of theoretical work: that of Foucault, and that of virtue
ethicists working in the Anglo-Saxon philosophical tradition. Proponents
of the virtue-ethics approach in anthropology argue that a focus on
self-cultivation as a process allows for sufficient attention to be paid
to self-conscious reflection. Reflection and the freedom it entails,
they argue, are essential aspects of ethical life that traditional
social scientific approaches to ethics – Durkheimian approaches – simply&amp;nbsp;ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There appears to remain an area of ethical experience, however, that
neither approach can easily accommodate. Since virtue ethics sees
ethical judgment as the result of cultivation within a self-conscious
ethical tradition, it can no more account for ethical judgment outside
of or between traditions than the Durkheimian approach can. Yet history
is full of situations in which multiple, self-conscious ethical
traditions meet, and in which people try to judge each other, persuade
each other, or draw lessons from each other across the borders that
separate those traditions. These situations are what we call ‘speaking
ethically across borders’, and this is the phenomenon that the
conference will aim to&amp;nbsp;explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these situations, are people limited to using values with which
they are already familiar to interpret and judge other values? Or can
they genuinely learn from alternative ethical systems? If so, on what
conditions does this process depend? Is the capacity for or disposition
towards a cosmopolitan attitude to ethics itself a culturally specific
norm or a virtue to be perfected, or is it a necessary aspect of ethical
thought? Ethnographically speaking, how have people in fact used the
intellectual resources provided by one ethical tradition to judge
others? How have they sought to borrow from other traditions, or to
persuade followers of other traditions to adopt novel values and
practices? What meta-ethics have specific traditions proposed to govern
the relationship of members of the tradition to the mores of other&amp;nbsp;traditions?&lt;/p&gt;
