&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countless commentators have announced the advent of the post-truth
era, but while everyone seems to be talking about it, there is little
agreement about what it really means. This article argues that
anthropology can make an important and distinctive contribution to
understanding post-truth by treating it ethnographically. Commonly
proposed explanations for post-truth include changes in political
culture, in the structure of information in the digital age and
universal cognitive weaknesses that limit people’s capacity for critical
thought. While all these are likely important factors, they do not
account for the role of culture in creating and sustaining post-truth.
In fact, it is likely that culture, especially in the form of
metacognition, or thought about thought, plays an important role by
providing knowledge practices, techniques for allocating attention, and
especially competing theories of truth. Ethnographic methods provide
anthropologists with a distinctive window on post-truth cultures of&amp;nbsp;metacognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ignorance and politics. Some of what he has to say relates to policies
that aim to constrain the acquisition of knowledge. Here’s one example I
find particularly astounding, not because it is an unusual position to
take historically speaking, but because it comes from a political party
in an adversarial system. You would think that participants in such a
system would at least have to give lip service to the idea of clarity
and independent thinking, but perhaps it’s only children they don’t want
thinking about&amp;nbsp;thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOTS&lt;/span&gt;) (values
clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are
simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBE&lt;/span&gt;) (mastery learning)
which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging
the student’s fixed beliefs and undermining parental&amp;nbsp;authority.&lt;/p&gt;
