ignorance and politics. Some of what he has to say relates to policies
that aim to constrain the acquisition of knowledge. Here’s one example I
find particularly astounding, not because it is an unusual position to
take historically speaking, but because it comes from a political party
in an adversarial system. You would think that participants in such a
system would at least have to give lip service to the idea of clarity
and independent thinking, but perhaps it’s only children they don’t want
thinking about thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values
clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are
simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning)
which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging
the student’s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.&lt;/p&gt;
